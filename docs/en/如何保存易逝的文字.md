# How to Save Ephemeral Text

## Background

> The virus is too small to be seen, so we need to use a test kit. How does the test kit work? First, use polymerase chain reaction to amplify the amount of virus nucleic acid. Then, use fluorescent dyes to stain the virus nucleic acid, making it bright and eye-catching.
> Disasters are like test kits, they make everything bigger and more eye-catching. So we see unprecedented beauty and kindness, as well as incredible stupidity and ugliness. In fact, these things are always there.

This article will introduce methods for saving sensitive information before it is "404".

## Methods

Note: This article will use **Chrome browser** for demonstration.

### Install the Plugin

If you have a VPN, you can directly search for **Web Clipper** on [**Chrome Webstore**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=zh-CN), download and install the plugin.

If you see this screen after opening the above link:

Don't worry, this is normal. We can also download the plugin from another link:
[Download crx file from crx4chrome](https://www.crx4chrome.com/go.php?p=169618&s=1&l=https%3A%2F%2Ff2.crx4chrome.com%2Fcrx.php%3Fi%3Dmhfbofiokmppgdliakminbgdgcmbhbac%26v%3D1.18.0)

After the plugin is downloaded, follow the instructions in the following image to open the extension management page:

Drag the downloaded plugin here to install it.

### Configuration

We choose to use GitHub's Issues feature to host content.

If you don't have a GitHub account, you need to register one first: https://github.com/ (the process is not described here)
After registration, click [**this link**](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Web%20Clipper) to generate an AccessToken. Be sure to save the generated token, it will be used later.
Create a repository: https://github.com/new, public or private, as you decide.

Open the plugin page, and bind the corresponding AccessToken with the GitHub repository.

### Usage

When we open any article, we can clip it and set tags. The article will be stored in the corresponding repository in the form of an issue.
Even if the article is "404", we can still continue to read it here.

## Conclusion

> There is an old Chinese saying: "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened; heed only one side and you will be benighted." This sentence tells us that we can better restore the appearance of things and do the right thing only by looking at them from multiple perspectives; if we only believe in one-sided words, we cannot distinguish right from wrong. We should also treat information in this way.
