# Basic Components - Capacitors

## Unit Conversion

$$1F=1\cdot10^3mF=1\cdot10^6\mu F=1\cdot10^9nF=1\cdot10^{12}pF$$

## Capacitor Selection

- **Voltage Rating**: For derating purposes, choose 10V for 3.3V, 10V for 5V, 25V for 12V, 50V for 24V, and 100V for 48V.

## Capacitor Material Classification

|              | Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor | Tantalum Capacitor | Ceramic Capacitor |
| :----------: | :-----------------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
| Capacitance  |             0.1uF-3F             |     0.1uF-1000uF    |     0.5pF-100uF    |
|    Polarity   |                Yes                |         Yes          |         No          |
|   Voltage Rating   |             5V-500V             |        2V-50V        |      2V-1000V      |
|     ESR      |    Several tens of milliohms to 2.5 ohms (100KHZ/25℃)    | Several tens to several hundreds of milliohms (100KHZ/25℃) | Several milliohms to several hundreds of milliohms (100KHZ/25℃) |
|     ESL      |           Not more than 100nH           |         About 2nH         |          1-2nH          |
| Frequency Range |    Low frequency filtering, less than 600KHz    |    Medium and low frequency filtering, several hundred KHZ to several MHz    |     High frequency filtering, several MHz to several GHz     |
|    Weaknesses    | Narrow temperature range, electrolyte evaporation, heat generation caused by ripple current | Must be derated, otherwise failure will result in explosion | Welding temperature shock can cause failure, poor bending resistance, and significant differences in temperature characteristics of different materials |
|     Suggestion     | Used for energy storage, in environments below 75℃, not recommended for high frequency switching power supplies | Voltage rating should be selected at twice the value; filtering of DC voltage above 15V is not recommended, especially in cases where the power supply changes rapidly, surge impact failure is significant | Wiring should not be placed in stress areas and avoid high temperature areas. |

## Uses of Capacitors

### Filtering

Filter out noise. Large capacitors filter low frequencies, while small capacitors filter high frequencies.

### Decoupling / Bypassing

Simply put, bypass capacitors are placed near the power supply, while decoupling capacitors are placed near the chip.

The purpose of decoupling/bypass capacitors is to bypass high-frequency noise in the system to GND. Typically, a small capacitance capacitor (typically 0.1uF) is connected in parallel between the power pin and GND to filter out high-frequency noise and stabilize the voltage.

The difference between decoupling and bypass capacitors is that decoupling capacitors are used to filter out interference in the output signal (such as the output pin of a voltage regulator), while bypass capacitors are used to filter out interference in the input signal (such as the power pin of a microcontroller). Decoupling capacitors are generally larger (above 10uF), while bypass capacitors are generally selected based on the resonance frequency (0.1/0.01uF).

### Tuning

Tuning capacitors are used to adjust the frequency of an oscillating circuit to resonate with another circuit that is already oscillating.

### Coupling

The purpose of coupling capacitors is to block DC and allow AC to pass through. The capacitor and its load form a filter that filters out low-frequency signals and retains high-frequency signals, forming a high-pass filter.

Coupling capacitors are used to connect two circuits and only allow AC signals to pass through by charging and discharging the capacitor and transmitting to the next level circuit.

### Energy Storage

Energy storage capacitors are used to collect and store charges for later use.

## Considerations for Choosing Capacitors

Pay attention to the voltage rating, and do not reverse polarized capacitors.
