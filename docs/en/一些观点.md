# Some Opinions

## About Entrepreneurship

### Is the Idea Feasible?

1. How big is the market demand?
   1. Define who the users are
   2. Discover their needs and desires
   3. Define your value proposition
   4. Build an MVP product
   5. Test with users
   6. Iterate quickly until you find PMF
2. How many people are doing it?
3. Why can you do it?

> Value can be disguised in many forms - money, time-saving, enjoyment, etc.

### Product or Project?

For early-stage entrepreneurs, it is often **doing both products and projects**. 
Taking on projects is for survival, while building products paves the way for rapid growth in the future.

When unsure of which product direction to choose, one can think about which needs have universality and can potentially become a product while working on projects. Lastly, **the specific product direction is a tactical issue, and you must understand the overall trend of your chosen industry and technology field at the strategic level.** Choice is more important than effort.

#### Product

- Meets a certain level of standardization, universality, and replicability
- Generally requires a large investment in the early stages
- Has the potential for explosive growth
- Highly competitive, generally only allowing a few companies to survive in a given market
- Capital markets are more inclined towards the potential high growth and high returns of products

#### Project

- "One order or no order, eat today or not tomorrow"
- Fast capital turnover, does not require a large investment
- Generally grows slowly
- Allows for the existence of many small companies
- Capital will not prioritize it

## About Writing

### Methods

### Axioms and Examples

**After abstracting the essence of things into an axiom, do not forget to provide examples.** Just like in physics or mathematics, axioms are generally difficult to apply directly. What is useful are the theorems derived from axioms and more specific rules.

Some things that one has experienced oneself are often memorable, but for readers, specific examples or explanations are needed to support the point, making the axiom more persuasive.

### User Psychology

Only analyzing the use of user psychology in viral articles.

#### 1. Emotional

Research shows that articles that evoke low-energy emotions such as sadness are rarely shared, while those that evoke high-energy emotions such as awe, anger, and anxiety are the opposite, able to get more shares, with anger being the easiest to spread virally.

To make readers angry, there is no need to belittle or insult, just write content that makes people angry. Anger is usually directed towards the topic, not the author or publisher. Inciting readers' anger usually requires enough capacity to handle controversial topics. Controversial blog posts receive an average of twice as many comments as non-controversial posts.

Awe is a safer emotion, especially for brands that want to avoid arousing anger. Awe is greater than surprise. This is why people prefer to watch movies about the big bang and legendary heroic figures.

#### 2. Long Articles

Long articles are shared more; the correlation between article length and sharing rate is higher than other variables. Professor Ward, who led the study, believes there is a causal relationship. "If I really care about a topic, I don't want to share shallow surface-level articles with my friends or readers."

Another study shows that although long articles get more shares, their comment count is often low. This may be because people do not read them from beginning to end.

#### 3. Expressing Real Emotions

Posts full of emotions are more likely to go viral, as people want to have emotional experiences when reading. Writer Walter Kirn said that excellent personal essays and memoirs should start with the author's most embarrassing content, which is where the conflict and emotion lies. Sharing this part of the content can also prove that the reader is a real, flesh-and-blood, flawed person.

When writing ads, people may not want to start with shame, but sharing some real emotions can help people let down their guard.

#### 4. Practical Information

Surprising, attractive, and practical content can get more shares. This may be the most intuitive finding in the research.

Ward believes that the main motivation for internet reading is people seeking answers to certain questions, such as how to invest in a personal retirement account or the best way to clean hardwood floors. Answers to these questions are naturally popular.

#### 5. Fame

Well-known authors have a huge impact on whether their articles can be shared. Fame accumulates in a cycle, and existing fame can bring even greater fame, especially on the internet.

#### 6. Homepage / Headline

Posts published on the homepage are more likely to be widely spread. People are surrounded by massive amounts of information every day, and only by putting content in the most prominent place can readers be ensured to see it. In an age of scarce attention, content hidden in corners is difficult to notice.

#### 7. Humor, Criticism, and Emotion

Content that is widely spread virally is mostly humorous. In addition, 60% of viral ads are produced by small companies.

Humor, satire, and lack of restraint cannot solve all problems, but they are essential prerequisites for viral advertising.

#### 8. Viral Spread

If you want your content to be spread virally, every content producer should carefully answer the following questions before publishing:

- Does the article provide a detailed introduction to the topic? Is the length sufficient?
- Can this content stimulate high-energy emotions such as anger, awe, and anxiety?
- Does the tone of the article convey emotions?
- Is this content particularly practical? Interesting? Or surprising and unexpected?
- Does the author have fame or credibility?
- Is this content really interesting?
- If your answer is yes, congratulations, this is an article that can be spread virally.

## About Personal Development

### Manufacturing and Sales

Naval, a famous venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, tweeted a golden sentence that was liked by more than 10,000 people.

**He said: "Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable."**

His meaning is that a successful company must have both excellent manufacturing and sales capabilities. A successful company not only needs to know how to create excellent products, but also how to sell them.

This is why companies have CEO and CTO roles. Generally speaking, the CEO is responsible for sales (including financing) and management, while the CTO is responsible for manufacturing. If one of these roles is not done well, the company cannot succeed.

Naval went on to say that the most powerful people in the world are those who can both manufacture and sell. Such people can create an industry. For example, Elon Musk is such a person. He understands technology and can make engineers create what he wants. He also knows how to sell and can make the whole world crazy about Tesla cars. Steve Jobs was also such a person. He knew what customers wanted and what Apple could create, and almost single-handedly made Apple the world's most valuable company.

If we view our own lives as a project, success in life is the same. We need both real skills and the ability to promote ourselves.

Naval said that in general, it is easier for makers to learn sales than for salespeople to learn to make. For example, it is easier for programmers to learn operations than for operations personnel to learn programming. Therefore, my idea is that it is best to major in some courses related to manufacturing (such as computer science) in college, and minor in some courses related to sales (such as economics). This combination is more reasonable.

## About Survival

> Survival is an instant strategy game, and everyone is a player in this game. When you achieve financial freedom, you are the winner of the game.
>
> Specifically, there are two types of games: wealth games and status games. Players in the wealth game pursue more wealth, while players in the status game pursue higher status.
>
> In ancient times, the higher the status, the more wealth one had. Being a high-ranking official meant getting rich, so everyone played the status game. In modern society, the wealth game and the status game have gradually become unrelated. You can get rich without being a high-ranking official, so there are more players in the wealth game.
>
> These two games have essential differences. **The status game is always zero-sum, with winners and losers.** For example, if I become the department head, you cannot become one. Therefore, the status game is very dangerous, and you must always guard against other players' cold guns. The wealth game is not zero-sum. If I build a beautiful house, it does not prevent you from building one too. If I make money, it does not affect the interests of others and may even make others better off. For example, Steve Jobs founded Apple, and others had better electronic products to use.
>
> **Entrepreneurship is a wealth game, and politics is a status game.** For the above reasons, I believe that entrepreneurship is worth participating in, but politics is not. Some entrepreneurial projects are also zero-sum, such as ticket grabbing technology, second killing technology, game cheating, etc., which are not worth participating in.
