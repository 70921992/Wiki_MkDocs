# Basic Components - Optocoupler

An optocoupler is a device that integrates a light-emitting diode (LED) and a photodetector in one package.

## Function of Optocoupler

In an optocoupler, the primary side (LED side) and the secondary side (light-receiving device side) are electrically insulated. Therefore, even if the potentials of the primary and secondary sides (even the GND potential) are different, the primary side electrical signal can be transmitted to the secondary side. The optocoupler isolates the two circuits.

## Parameters of Optocoupler

LED side:

- Forward Voltage (Vf): Vf refers to the voltage drop of the LED itself under a given operating current. Common low-power LEDs are usually tested for forward voltage with If=20mA. Of course, different LEDs, test conditions, and test results may vary.
- Reverse Voltage (Vr): The maximum reverse voltage that the LED can withstand. Exceeding this reverse voltage may damage the LED. When using AC pulse to drive the LED, special attention should be paid not to exceed the reverse voltage.
- Reverse Current (Ir): The reverse current flowing through the LED under the maximum reverse voltage.
- Maximum Power Dissipation (Pd): The maximum power that the LED can withstand. Exceeding this power may damage the LED.
- Peak Wavelength (λp): The central wavelength value of the light emitted by the LED. The wavelength directly determines the color of the light. For bi-color or multi-color LEDs, there will be several different peak wavelength values.
- Forward Current (If): If refers to the forward current flowing through the LED when it is normally emitting light. Different LEDs also have different maximum allowable currents.
- Peak Forward Current (Ifp): Ifp refers to the peak forward current flowing through the LED. To ensure the life of the LED, a pulse form is usually used to drive the LED. The Ifp given in the LED specification sheet is usually calculated based on a pulse current with a pulse width of 0.1ms and a duty cycle of 1/10.

Phototransistor side:

- Collector Current (Ic): The current flowing through the collector of the phototransistor, usually indicating its maximum value.
- Collector-Emitter Voltage (Vceo): The voltage that the collector-emitter of the phototransistor can withstand.
- Emitter-Collector Voltage (Veco): The voltage that the emitter-collector of the phototransistor can withstand.
- Reverse Cutoff Current (Iceo)
- Collector-Emitter Saturation Voltage (Vce(sat))

Transmission Characteristics:

- Current Transfer Ratio (CTR): Usually expressed by the DC current transfer ratio. When the output voltage is constant, it is equal to the percentage of the DC output current IC to the DC input current IF.
- Rise Time (Tr) & Fall Time (Tf)

Isolation Characteristics:

- Isolation Voltage (Vio): The insulation voltage value between the input and output of the optocoupler.
- Isolation Capacitance (Cio): The capacitance value between the input and output of the optocoupler.
- Isolation Resistance (Rio): The insulation resistance value between the input and output of the semiconductor optocoupler.
