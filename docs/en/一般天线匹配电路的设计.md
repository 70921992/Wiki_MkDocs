# Design of General Antenna Matching Circuit

Ideally, for antenna matching, we hope that the output impedance of the source end, the transmission line impedance, and the input impedance of the load end are consistent (generally 50Ω).

However, in actual situations, such as connector, welding, and errors in antenna impedance, the impedance of the circuit after the source end may not match the impedance of the source end. Therefore, antenna circuits generally need to reserve matching circuits, and generally reserve π-type matching circuits, which will be explained in detail below.

## Measuring the Original Impedance

First, we need to know the situation without a matching circuit. At this time, the π-type matching circuit is connected in series with a 0Ω resistor welded to the device (cannot be directly short-circuited with solder, which will cause different parasitic parameters) and the device parallel to the ground is left empty without welding.

Use a network analyzer for measurement. The specific method can refer to the article [**Use of Network Analyzer**](https://wiki-power.com/en/%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%E4%BB%AA%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8). At this time, the initial load impedance value can be measured. Assuming that the initial impedance we measured is very close to 50Ω, we can directly use it without a matching circuit, which can not only reduce costs but also reduce losses caused by devices. If it is measured as (40.6-13j)Ω, then adjust the matching on the Smith chart to adjust the load impedance to 50Ω.

## Adjusting the Matching

The matching can be adjusted on the Smith chart, and [**SimNEC**](http://www.ae6ty.com/smith_charts.html) software can be used for this purpose. The principle of the Smith chart can refer to the article [**Basics of Smith Chart**](https://wiki-power.com/en/%E5%8F%B2%E5%AF%86%E6%96%AF%E5%9C%86%E5%9B%BE%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80). By adding components from the load end to the source end, the load impedance is adjusted to 50Ω.

Matching principles:

- The inductance and capacitance values should not be too small (to reduce the influence of error values) and should be as common as possible (to increase interchangeability).
- The ground capacitance value should not be too large (the larger the capacitance value, the smaller the capacitance impedance, which leads to a large amount of signal flowing to the ground).
- Design as a low-pass filter as much as possible (can also suppress high-frequency harmonics).
- The distance between the two inductors should not be too close, otherwise, mutual inductance may affect the matching effect.
- The impedance trajectory of the entire frequency band should converge as much as possible.
- When laying out the PCB, the matching circuit should be as close to the antenna as possible to minimize the delay of the transmission line and make the actual value closer to the theoretical set value.
