### Output Voltage Regulation

XL2009E1 provides an internal reference voltage of 1.25V. The output voltage is divided by resistors from $V_{OUT}$ and input to the FB pin for internal comparison and adjustment. The divider resistors are recommended to have a deviation of 1% or lower and a temperature coefficient of 100 ppm or lower. Choosing larger resistor values for the divider is beneficial for improving light load efficiency, but if they are too large, the regulator will be more susceptible to noise and voltage errors from the FB input current. It is recommended to use a low-side resistor $R_1$ value of 4.7k and calculate the high-side resistor $R_2$ using the formula:

$$
V_{OUT}=1.25*(1+\frac{R_2}{R_1})
$$

### Schottky Diode Selection

The rated breakdown voltage of the diode should be 25% higher than the maximum input voltage. For optimal reliability, the rated current of the diode should be equal to the maximum output current of the regulator. When the input voltage is much higher than the output voltage, the average current of the diode will be lower, and a diode with a lower average current rating can be used, approximately $(1-D) * I_{OUT}$, but the peak current rating should be higher than the maximum load current.

The datasheet for XL2009E1 provides a direct selection table (3A):

| Input Voltage | Model       |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| 20V           | SK32        |
| 30V           | SK33/30WQ03 |
| 40V           | SK34/30WQ04 |
| 50V           | SK35/30WQ05 |
| 60V           | SK36        |
