# RF - Antenna Basics

This article will introduce the principles and basic parameters of antennas.

## Principles of Antennas

An antenna is a transducer that converts conducted waves into free electromagnetic waves in space, or collects free electromagnetic waves in space and converts them into electrical signals (these two modes are theoretically equivalent, but active antennas are an exception).

Antennas originated from resonators composed of inductors and parallel plate capacitors. By pulling the plates apart, the inductance will decrease. By pulling them a certain distance and using the inductance of the wire itself as a resonant inductance, a dipole antenna can be formed.

## Parameters of Antennas

### Radiation Density

Assuming an ideal isotropic microwave transmitter, which is a point in space that generates spherical waves and radiates uniformly in all directions.

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220615094625.png)

When a transmission power $P_S$ is applied to this microwave transmitter, the radiation density (also known as power density) at a distance $r$ is:

$$
S=\frac{P_S}{4\pi r^2}
$$

Radiation density can also be defined as the product of the electric and magnetic field strengths in the far field:

$$
S=E \cdot H
$$

### Radiation Pattern

The radiation pattern is used to describe the three-dimensional radiation effect of the antenna in the far field. For an isotropic radiation generator (referred to as a point source antenna below), the radiation size in each direction in space is the same, but it cannot be polarized in a specific direction. For general antennas, such as dipole and monopole antennas, they have directionality. For example, the 3D radiation pattern of a short dipole antenna in free space is shown below. It can be observed that there is no radiation density in the direction of the antenna axis:

In addition to using 3D graphics to represent radiation, horizontal and vertical 2D profile graphs (also known as main plane radiation patterns) are also commonly used. The following are the horizontal and vertical radiation patterns of a dipole antenna:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220615140313.png)

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220615140336.png)

The radiation pattern is generally plotted in polar coordinates, which can intuitively show the degree of radiation in each direction. In some cases (such as high directional antennas), the radiation pattern can also be represented in Cartesian coordinates (X-Y system), which can more clearly highlight the details of the main lobe and adjacent side lobes:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220615140902.png)

Based on the radiation pattern, more parameters of the antenna can be determined:

- **Side Lobe Suppression (or Side Lobe Level)**: The difference between the main lobe and the highest side lobe.
- **Half-Power Beamwidth (HPBW)**: The range between the left and right angles where the main lobe drops 3dB from its maximum height, usually presented in both horizontal and vertical 2D radiation patterns.
- **Front-to-Back Ratio**: The ratio of the peak gain of a directional antenna in the forward direction to the gain in the back direction (180°), usually expressed in dB.

### Directivity

The directional factor D (also known as the directivity coefficient) of an antenna represents the ratio of the radiation intensity Fmax in its main radiation direction to the radiation intensity Fi of a lossless point source antenna with the same power (Pt). Here, we use the Poynting vector to represent power density instead of radiation intensity:

$$
\vec S=\vec E \times \vec H
$$

Note: in the far field, $\vec S$ is perpendicular to $\vec E$, and $\vec S$ and $\vec E$ are perpendicular to $\vec H$.

Power density is measured at the same distance r from the antenna. Therefore, when Fi = Pt / (4π), we can obtain:

$$
D=\frac{F_{max}}{F_i}
$$

### Efficiency

Antenna efficiency η is generally defined as the ratio of the radiated power of the antenna to the input power. A high-efficiency antenna can radiate most of the input energy, while a low-efficiency antenna absorbs most of the energy as losses inside the antenna or reflects it back due to impedance mismatch. For a passive antenna, whether it is used as a transmitting or receiving antenna, its efficiency is the same. This property is called antenna reciprocity. The formula for antenna radiation efficiency εR is as follows:

$$
\varepsilon_R=\frac{P_{refl}}{P_{forw}}\cdot 100\%
$$

Antenna efficiency is not only expressed as a percentage, but also commonly expressed in dB. For example, 10% efficiency is equivalent to -10dB, and 50% efficiency is equivalent to -3dB.

The above formula represents the radiation efficiency of the antenna, and there is another efficiency called the total efficiency of the antenna εr. The relationship between them is that the total efficiency is equal to the radiation efficiency multiplied by the impedance matching loss ML:

$$
\varepsilon_r=M_L\cdot\varepsilon_R
$$

Since the impedance matching loss value is between 0 and 1, the total efficiency of the antenna is always less than the radiation efficiency. If the impedance is completely matched, the two efficiencies are equal. In practice, the efficiency of the antenna usually refers to the total efficiency considering the impedance matching loss, so better impedance matching can improve the actual efficiency of the antenna.

### Gain

Antenna gain is used to measure the ability of the antenna to transmit and receive signals in a specific direction. Gain is closely related to the antenna directional pattern. The narrower the main lobe beam width and the smaller the side lobe, the higher the gain.

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220615161740.png)

Under the same conditions, the higher the gain, the more concentrated the energy, the narrower the beam, and the farther the radio wave propagates. However, the coverage angle will become smaller, so the gain of the antenna should be selected reasonably in practical applications.

The gain of the antenna corresponds to the directional factor, which represents the ratio of the radiation intensity Fmax in the main radiation direction to the radiation intensity Fi0 of a lossless point source antenna with the same power (Pt0). When Fi0 = Pt / (4π), we can obtain:

$$
G=\frac{F_{max}}{F_{i0}}
$$

Unlike the directional factor, the gain also takes into account the efficiency η of the antenna:

$$
G=\eta \cdot D
$$

If the efficiency of the antenna is 100%, the gain and directional factor are equal. However, in reality, the efficiency cannot reach 100%, so in practical measurements, the gain is more commonly used than the directional factor.

Gain and directional factor are usually expressed in dB, gain g(dB) = 10logG, directional factor d(dB) = 10logD. This leads to the units of dBd (relative to a half-wave dipole antenna) and dBi (relative to a point source antenna), and their relationship is dBi = dBd + 2.15.

Some additional notes on gain:

- The antenna is a passive device and does not generate energy. Antenna gain is only a measure of the ability to effectively concentrate energy towards a specific direction for radiation/reception of electromagnetic waves.
- The gain of the antenna is produced by the superposition of oscillators. The higher the gain, the longer the antenna length. For every 3dB increase in gain, the volume doubles.

### Practical Gain

The definition of gain assumes that the impedance between the antenna and the source end is perfectly matched, but this is rarely achieved in practice. Therefore, the gain value measured under actual non-ideal matching conditions is called the practical gain of the antenna. Its formula is defined as follows:

$$
G_{pract}=(1-|r|^2)\cdot G
$$

where r represents the reflection coefficient, which will be explained in detail below.

The effective area $A_W$ of an antenna is a parameter specifically defined for receiving antennas, used to measure the ability of the antenna to pick up signals. It is defined as the ratio of the maximum received power $P_{rmax}$ and the plane wave power density $S$:

$$
A_W=\frac{P_{rmax}}{S}
$$

For aperture antennas such as parabolic reflectors or planar arrays, the effective area is the product of the physical area and the aperture efficiency $q$:

$$
A_W=A_g\cdot q
$$

The effective area of an antenna is also related to its gain (which can be mutually derived):

$$
A_W=\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi}\cdot G
$$

### Input Impedance

The input impedance of an antenna is a crucial parameter, which is a complex value composed of a real resistance and a reactive impedance:

$$
Z_{in}=R_{in}+jX_{in}
$$

The real resistance $R_{in}$ is composed of radiation resistance $R_R$ and loss resistance $R_L$:

$$
R_{in}=R_R+R_L
$$

For small antennas, the radiation resistance $R_R$ needs to be specified at the position on the antenna, as it is space-dependent (the ratio of radiated power to the root-mean-square current on the antenna). The same applies to the antenna current, which requires specifying the feed point of the antenna to obtain the maximum current value.

If the antenna is operating in a resonant state, the imaginary part of the input impedance is 0. Electrically short linear antennas usually exhibit capacitance ($X_{in}<0$), while electrically long linear antennas usually exhibit inductance ($X_{in}>0$).

### Nominal Impedance

The nominal impedance $Z_n$ is usually defined as the characteristic impedance of the antenna connection line, typically 50Ω. The antenna impedance usually needs to match it.

### Impedance Matching

If the impedance between the antenna, connection line, and source end does not match, discontinuity may occur. In the example in the figure below, some of the energy emitted from the source end is reflected and cannot reach the antenna, thereby affecting the transmission effect; conversely, not all the energy received by the antenna can be transmitted to the receiver:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220615173026.png)

Impedance matching can be viewed using the equivalent circuit diagram of the transmitting antenna. Maximum transmission power can only be obtained when $Z_S=Z_{in}$:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220615173346.png)

### Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)

If the impedance does not match, it may cause some energy to be reflected back, resulting in standing waves. We use the voltage standing wave ratio $s$ to describe the characteristics of standing waves, defined as the ratio of the maximum and minimum voltages (or calculated based on the ratio of currents) on the transmission line:

$$
s=\frac{V_{max}}{V_{min}}=\frac{I_{max}}{I_{min}}
$$

In addition, the VSWR can also be calculated based on the amplitudes (or powers) of the incident voltage $V_{forw}$ and the reflected voltage $V_{refl}$:

$$
s=\frac{|V_{forw}|+|V_{refl}|}{|V_{forw}|-|V_{refl}|}=\frac{\sqrt{P_{forw}}+\sqrt{P_{forw}}}{\sqrt{P_{forw}}-\sqrt{P_{forw}}}
$$

The ratio of the amplitude of the reflected voltage $V_{refl}$ to the incident voltage $V_{forw}$ is called the reflection coefficient $r$:

$$
r=\frac{V_{refl}}{V_{forw}}
$$

Therefore, the VSWR can also be calculated based on the reflection coefficient:

$$
r=\frac{1+|r|}{1-|r|}
$$

In addition, we define the logarithmic form of the reflection coefficient as the return loss $a_r$:

$$
a_r=-20\log|r|
$$

$$
=-20\log\frac{V_{refl}}{V_{forw}}=-10\log\frac{P_{refl}}{P_{forw}}
$$

There are many parameters to measure the quality of impedance matching, and their simple correspondence is as follows:



| VSWR  | R     | $a_r$ | Reflection Energy |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------------- |
| 1.002 | 0.001 | 60dB  | \                |
| 1.01  | 0.005 | 46dB  | \                |
| 1.1   | 0.05  | 26dB  | 0.2%             |
| 1.2   | 0.1   | 20dB  | 0.8%             |
| 1.5   | 0.2   | 14dB  | 4%               |
| 2.0   | 0.33  | 9.5dB | 11.1%            |
| 2.0   | 0.5   | 6dB   | 25%              |
| 5.0   | 0.67  | 3.5dB | 44.4%            |

### Antenna Factor

Antenna factor (antenna coefficient / antenna ratio) is also known as sensor coefficient or conversion coefficient. It is usually used for receiving antennas and is defined as the ratio of electric field strength to the output voltage measured at the feeding point (under 50Ω):

$$
K=\frac{E}{V}
$$

Most of the time, it is also expressed in its logarithmic form (dBm):

$$
k=20log K
$$

If the antenna has been calibrated at the factory, the value of the antenna factor is generally fixed. The relationship between the antenna factor and the actual gain is:

$$
K=\frac{9.73}{\lambda \cdot \sqrt{G}}
$$

$$
k=-29dB+20log(\frac{f}{MHz})-g
$$

### Bandwidth

The bandwidth parameter of an antenna is used to measure its available frequency range, within which the antenna's performance can meet the requirements. The standard for bandwidth is usually impedance matching (VSWR<1.5), and other parameters such as gain or sidelobe suppression can also be used as bandwidth standards.

For broadband antennas, the ratio of the highest to lowest usable frequency is determined. For example, a ratio of 2:1 is called a doubling frequency, and a ratio of 10:1 is called a tenfold frequency:

$$
BW=\frac{f_H}{f_L}
$$

Broadband antennas refer to BW≥2. In addition, there is another definition of bandwidth that only applies to narrowband antennas:

$$
BW=\frac{f_H-f_L}{f_C}\cdot100\%
$$

Where $f_C$ represents the center frequency. The value of this BW can exceed 100% (≤200%).
