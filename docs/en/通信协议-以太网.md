## Embedded Ethernet Hardware

The hardware of an embedded system's Ethernet mainly consists of these components: MAC controller, PHY chip, network transformer, and RJ45 connector, and some systems may also have a DMA controller.

Generally, the CPU/MCU will integrate the MAC on the chip (since MAC is a digital circuit, considering chip area and architecture, it is generally integrated on the chip), so the external hardware that needs to be designed is the PHY, transformer, and interface. In many cases, the network transformer is also integrated into the RJ45 connector.

### MAC

MAC (Media Access Control Sublayer Protocol) is located in the data link layer of the OSI seven-layer structure and is mainly responsible for controlling and connecting the physical layer media. MAC follows the IEEE-802.3 standard.

When sending data, the MAC protocol can determine in advance whether data can be sent. If it can be sent, it adds some control information to the data, and then sends the data and control information in a specified format to the physical layer.

When receiving data, the MAC protocol first determines whether the input information has transmission errors. If there are no errors, it removes the control information and sends it to the LLC layer.

### PHY

PHY is a physical interface transceiver that implements the physical layer of Ethernet. PHY is defined by the IEEE-802.3 standard and includes the Media Independent Interface (MII)/Gigabit Media Independent Interface (GMII) sublayer, Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS), Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) sublayer, Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer, and MDI sublayer.

When sending data, PHY receives data transmitted from MAC (for PHY, there is no concept of frames, it is all data regardless of address, and the data still has CRC. For 100BaseTX, because it uses 4B/5B encoding, every 4 bits adds 1 bit of error detection code), then converts the parallel data into serial stream data, encodes the data according to the physical layer's encoding rules, and then converts it into an analog signal to send the data out. The process is reversed when receiving data. The typical internal structure diagram of PHY is shown below (RTL8211E):
