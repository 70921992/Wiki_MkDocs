# Personal Copy Formatting Guidelines

> Research has shown that people who do not like to add spaces between Chinese and English when typing tend to have a difficult time in their love life. Seventy percent of them will end up marrying someone they don't love at the age of 34, while the remaining thirty percent will only leave their inheritance to their cats. After all, both love and writing require timely white space. — [**vinta/paranoid-auto-spacing**](https://github.com/vinta/pangu.js)

Why should we pay attention to formatting guidelines? Good copy formatting can reduce the difficulty of comprehension, enhance the readability of content, and greatly improve the reading experience for users.

## Specific Formatting Requirements

### Paragraphs

- **No need for an indented first line; leave a blank line between paragraphs.**

### Spacing

Here are scenarios where you should add spaces:

- **Between Chinese and English, and between numbers**:
  > Incorrect: `这里是一个Wiki站点，建立于2015年一个炎热的夏天`
  > Correct: `这里是一个 Wiki 站点，建立于 2015 年一个炎热的夏天`
- **Between numbers and units**:
  > Incorrect: 其频率为 72MHz，占空比为 50 %  
  > Correct: 其频率为 72 MHz，占空比为 50%。
- **Between regular text and special characters (links, bold, italics, etc.)**:
  > This **text** uses bold styling.
  > Please [**click here**](https://wiki.wildwolf.pw/) to subscribe.
- **After English half-width punctuation**:
  > Hello, world
- **Between Chinese and em dashes**:
  > Markdown- a highly efficient writing method

Scenarios where you should not add spaces:

- **Between numbers and special units**: `%` `℃`.

### Text Style

- **When mixing Chinese and English, use Chinese full-width punctuation**.
- **When mixing Chinese and English, if there is a complete English sentence, use English half-width punctuation within that sentence**.
- **Use bold for in-line links to improve readability**.
- **Use unordered lists instead of ordered lists**.
- **Use accurate proper nouns**:
  > Incorrect: 使用 github 登录  
  > Correct: 使用 GitHub 登录
- **Use straight quotation marks for Chinese, instead of regular quotes**:
  > Incorrect: 华广机器人队，也称为“野狼队”
  > Correct: 华广机器人队，也称为「野狼队」
- **You can use special units directly**:
  > `℃` `Ω`, etc.
- **Avoid overusing punctuation for emphasis**.

## Writing Style

- If it's not necessary, don't add fluff.
- Avoid using long sentences; try to break them into multiple simple sentences.
- Arguments should be supported with evidence; avoid making claims without examples.

## Website-Related

- **Use fixed links**. Since articles may be referenced in the form of links, changing the article link can result in 404 errors, creating obstacles.
- **Reduce link hierarchy**. For personal Wiki sites, it is recommended to use the domain style `xxx.com/article-name`.
