# Personal Copywriting Formatting Guidelines

> Research shows that people who don't like to add spaces between Chinese and English when typing have a hard time in their emotional lives. 70% of them will marry someone they don't love at the age of 34, and the remaining 30% will only leave their inheritance to their cats. After all, both love and writing require timely whitespace. - [**vinta/paranoid-auto-spacing**](https://github.com/vinta/pangu.js)

Why pay attention to formatting guidelines? Good copywriting formatting can reduce comprehension difficulty, enhance content readability, and greatly improve the user reading experience.

## Specific Formatting Requirements

### Paragraphs

- **The first line does not need to be indented with a space, and there should be a blank line between paragraphs.**

### Spaces

Spaces should be added in the following situations:

- **Between Chinese and English, and between numbers**:
  > Incorrect: `这里是一个Wiki站点，建立于2015年一个炎热的夏天`
  > Correct: `这里是一个 Wiki 站点，建立于 2015 年一个炎热的夏天`
- **Between numbers and units**:
  > Incorrect: 其频率为 72MHz，占空比为 50 %  
  > Correct: 其频率为 72 MHz，占空比为 50%。
- **Between regular text and special characters (links, bold, italics, etc.)**:
  > This **font** uses bold style  
  > Please [**click here**](https://wiki.wildwolf.pw/) to subscribe
- **After English half-width punctuation**:
  > Hello, world
- **Between Chinese and dashes**:
  > Markdown- an efficient way of writing

Spaces should not be added in the following situations:

- **Between numbers and special units**: `%` `℃`.

### Text Styles

- **When mixing Chinese and English, use Chinese full-width punctuation**
- **When mixing Chinese and English, if there is a complete English sentence, use English half-width punctuation within that sentence**
- **Inline links are generally bolded to improve readability**
- **Use unordered lists instead of ordered lists**
- **Use accurate proper nouns**:
  > Incorrect: 使用 github 登录  
  > Correct: 使用 GitHub 登录
- **Use straight quotes for Chinese instead of regular quotes**:
  > Incorrect: 华广机器人队，也称为“野狼队”
  > Correct: 华广机器人队，也称为「野狼队」
- **Special units can be used directly**:
  > `℃` `Ω`, etc.
- **Do not repeat punctuation for emphasis**:

## Writing Style

- If it is not necessary, do not add entities.
- Avoid using long sentences and try to break them down into multiple simple sentences.
- Arguments should be supported by evidence, and avoid only stating the theory without examples.

## Website Related

- **Use fixed links.** Because articles may be referenced in the form of links by others, if the article link changes, it may lead to a 404 page, creating obstacles.
- **Reduce link hierarchy.** For personal Wiki sites, the recommended domain style is `xxx.com/article name`.
