# RF - Components and Systems - Capacitors

Capacitors are widely used in RF applications, such as bypassing, interstage coupling, resonant circuits, and filters.

## Parallel Plate Capacitors

A capacitor is any device consisting of two conductive surfaces separated by an insulating material or dielectric. The dielectric is typically ceramic, air, paper, mica, plastic, film, glass, or oil. The capacitance of a capacitor is the property that allows it to store charge when there is a potential difference between the conductors. Capacitance is measured in farads (F).

A capacitor is composed of two conductive surfaces separated by an insulating material or dielectric. The dielectric is typically ceramic, air, paper, mica, plastic, film, glass, or oil. The capacitance value represents the property of allowing charge storage between two conductors when there is a potential difference:

$$
C=\frac{Q}{V}
$$

where the unit of capacitance value $C$ is farads (F) and the unit of charge value $Q$ is coulombs (C). Because the unit of farads is too large, we have $1uF=10^{-6}F$ and $1pF=10^{-12}F$.

If we know the parallel plate area $A$, the distance between the parallel plates $d$ (in inches), and the dielectric constant $\varepsilon$ (in F/m) of the dielectric material, then the formula for calculating the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor can be expressed as:

$$
C=\frac{0.2249\varepsilon A}{d\varepsilon_0} pF
$$

where $\varepsilon_0$ is the dielectric constant in free space ($\varepsilon_0=8.854*10^{-12}F/m$).

## Capacitor Equivalent Circuit

A parallel plate capacitor is just an ideal capacitor. In the real world, the equivalent circuit of a capacitor is shown in the figure below:

where $C$ is the capacitance, $L$ is the lead inductance, $R_s$ is the dissipation factor (DF) or power factor (PF) of the capacitor, and $R_p$ represents the insulation resistance. More detailed definitions are as follows:

**Power Factor (PF)**:

In an ideal capacitor, the AC current leads the applied voltage by 90°. Because of the total series resistance ($Rs + Rp$) in the equivalent circuit, this phase angle $φ$ will be smaller in a practical capacitor. The power factor is a function of temperature, frequency, and dielectric material and is defined by the following formula:

$$
PF=\cos \phi
$$

**Insulation Resistance**:

The amount of DC current that flows through the capacitor dielectric when a voltage is applied. No material is completely insulating, so there will be leakage current. In the equivalent circuit, the path of this leakage current is represented by $R_p$, whose value is usually greater than 100,000 megaohms.

**Effective Series Resistance (ESR)**:

This resistance value is the combined equivalent value of $Rs + Rp$ and is the AC resistance of the capacitor. It is defined by the following formula:

$$
ESR=\frac{PF}{\omega C}(10^6)
$$

where $\omega=2 \pi f$.

**Dissipation Factor (DF)**:

The ratio of AC resistance to capacitive reactance in a capacitor is defined by the following formula:

$$
DF=\frac{ESR}{X_c}*100\%
$$

The quality factor Q derived from the dissipation factor is the reciprocal of the dissipation factor. The higher the quality factor, the better the performance of the capacitor.

The effects of these defects in capacitors can be seen in Figure 1-9. Here, the impedance characteristics of an ideal capacitor correspond to those of a practical capacitor. As shown in the figure, lead inductance becomes important as the operating frequency increases. Finally, at Fr, the inductance and capacitor are in series resonance. Then, above Fr, the capacitor behaves like an inductor. Generally, larger capacitors tend to have more internal inductance than smaller capacitors.

In a practical capacitor, the frequency and impedance variation curves affected by these factors are shown in the figure below:

As the frequency increases, the influence of lead inductance becomes greater, and ultimately, at $F_r$, the inductance and capacitor resonate in series. At higher frequencies, the capacitor behaves like an inductor. Generally, larger capacitors tend to have more inductance than smaller capacitors. For example, at a frequency of 250MHz, a 100nF capacitor has worse bypassing effect than a 300pF capacitor because, according to the formula for reactance $X_e=\frac{1}{\omega C}$, a larger capacitor has a smaller reactance at a specific frequency.

However, the situation may be the opposite in terms of radio frequency. At certain higher frequencies, a 100nF capacitor may produce a higher impedance than a 330pF capacitor. This is a problem that must be considered when designing circuits with frequencies higher than 100 MHz. The use of a network analyzer can show the impedance of a capacitor at a specific frequency.
