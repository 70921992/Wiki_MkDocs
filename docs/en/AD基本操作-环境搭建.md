This tutorial series is based on Altium Designer 19 (also compatible with 20), and I will also keep up with future versions.

## Adjusting Settings

To do a good job, we must first sharpen our tools. The first time you open Altium Designer, you can adjust some settings to make the tool more user-friendly. Find the **gear** icon in the upper right corner, **open the settings page**, and continue with the following operations.

### Setting Chinese

1. Click the **System - General** tab in the left list, and check the **Use localized resources** option under the **Localization** column.
2. Click **Apply** to save the settings and restart Altium Designer.

### PCB Editor

1. Click on the **PCB Editor** tab on the left-hand side.
2. Under the **General** tab in **Copper Pour Rebuild**, check the box for **Automatically Repour After Modification**. Under **Document Format Modification Report**, check the boxes for **Disable Opening of Old Version Reports** and **Disable Opening of New Version Reports**. Under **Other**, change the **Cursor Type** to **Large 90**.
3. Click on the **Display** tab, and under **Highlight Options**, check the box for **Apply Highlight During Interactive Editing**.
4. Click on the **Board Insight Color Overrides** tab, and under **Basic Style**, select **Solid (Override Color)**.
5. Click on the **DRC Violations Display** tab, and under **Conflict Overlay Style**, select **Solid (Overlay Color)**.
6. Click **Apply** to save the settings and restart Altium Designer.

### Panels

1. Close the settings page and select **View - Panels** from the main menu. Click on **Components** and **Messages**.
2. Click on the **Paperclip** icon in the upper right corner of the panel to dock it on the right-hand side.

### Setting the Background to Grid

1. Open any PCB file (or create a new one if there isn't one).
2. Press **Ctrl + G** to open the grid settings window.
3. Under **Display**, set both **Fine** and **Coarse** options to **Dots**.

## Input Method Compatibility

If you are unable to use keyboard shortcuts, check if you have switched to English mode (the input method status bar should display **ENG**). If this option is not available, follow these steps:

1. Open **Control Panel** and go to **Clock, Language, and Region - Language**.
2. Click on **Add a Language**, add **English**, and select **English (United States)**.
3. You can switch input methods on the desktop taskbar.

## Summary

In this chapter, we have configured the environment for Altium Designer and can now start designing PCBs happily :\)
