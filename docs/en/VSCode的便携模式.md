# Portable Mode for VS Code

VS Code natively supports portable mode, but extension settings and other resources are still stored in the default location on the local machine. This tutorial will introduce a method to fully portableize VS Code.

Download the `.zip` version of VS Code from the [**download page**](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads).

After extracting the files, do not open the software yet. Create a `data` folder in the root directory of the software, and create a `tmp` directory within it (optional, for saving TMP data).

Then you can open the software.
