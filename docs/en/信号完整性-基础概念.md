# Signal Integrity - Basic Concepts

Signal Integrity (SI) refers to the quality of signals on transmission lines. Good signal integrity means that the voltage levels on the transmission line reach the expected values without being too high or too low.

The reason for signal integrity issues is that the real-world digital levels (0/1) are not ideal, and the signal itself is an analog quantity. In low-speed circuits, signal integrity issues are not significant because interconnects are transparent to electrical signals, and analog circuit effects can be ignored. However, at high speeds (over 100MHz or rise time less than 1ns), the voltage or current waveform of the digital level will begin to distort, resulting in significant differences between the received and transmitted information, leading to errors. Therefore, signal integrity issues must be considered when designing high-speed circuits.

The broad concept of signal integrity covers three types of issues:

- **Signal Integrity (SI)**: refers to waveform distortion.
- **Power Integrity (PI)**: refers to noise on the power supply network and interconnects of related components.
- **Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)**: refers to the ability of electronic devices to operate normally in an electromagnetic field without being affected by electromagnetic interference or causing interference to other devices.

## Basic Principles of Signal Integrity

- Any signal interconnect is composed of a signal path and a return path. At each step of the signal's journey on the transmission line, it will experience instantaneous impedance. To achieve the best signal transmission quality, the instantaneous impedance should be constant, such as by ensuring that the transmission line has a uniform cross-section.
- Each signal has a return path, which is not just ground. Problems can be solved by analyzing the return path.
- For capacitors, edges that change rapidly will cause them to have low impedance. This capacitor refers not only to external capacitors but also to parasitic capacitors on the transmission line.
- For inductors, if the current magnitude or magnetic flux changes abruptly, a voltage will be generated at both ends, which may cause reflection noise, crosstalk, switch noise, ground bounce, rail collapse, electromagnetic interference, etc. When the current flowing through the ground return path inductance changes abruptly, the voltage generated on the ground return path is called ground bounce, which is the cause of switch noise and electromagnetic interference.
- Signal bandwidth refers to the highest frequency value of effective sine wave components (with reference to the same frequency square wave). The bandwidth of the interconnect model refers to the highest sine frequency at which the model can accurately predict the actual performance of the interconnect.
- In most cases, the formula for signal integrity is a defined or approximate value.
- The problem caused by lossy transmission lines is rising edge degradation. Due to skin effect and cutoff loss, signal loss increases with increasing frequency.

## Basic Problems of Signal Integrity

Broadly speaking, signal integrity can be divided into the following four types of problems:

- Signal distortion in a single network
  - Reflection (caused by instantaneous impedance changes)
  - Signal quality issues (frequency-related losses cause rising edge degradation in interconnects)
  - Timing errors (differential signal distortion caused by differences in electrical characteristics or length differences between multiple signals)
- Crosstalk between two or more networks (including power bounce and ground bounce)
- Rail collapse in power and ground distribution (PI)
- Electromagnetic interference and radiation from the entire system (EMC)
