# Basic Components - Inductors and Beads

## Inductors

### Inductor Selection

- Size
- Inductance value at working frequency
- Inductance value at switching frequency should be the actual required value
- The direct current resistance (DCR) of the coil should be as small as possible
- Working current should be reduced to 0.7 times the rated saturation current, rated rms current
- The alternating current resistance (ESR) should be as small as possible
- The higher the Q factor, the better
- Shielding type: shielded or unshielded, preferentially choose shielded
- Working frequency and winding voltage cannot be reduced
- Brand: TDK, MURATA, Sanritsu, SUMIDA are preferred for chip inductors

## Key Parameters of Inductors

#### Inductance L

Generally, the error is 10% or 20% (under test conditions of 1MHz frequency).

Difference in inductance value:

- Small inductance value: low DCR, high saturation current, better dynamics, larger ripple current.
- Large inductance value: small ripple current.

#### Direct Current Resistance DCR

It can be understood as a parasitic parameter, which is closely related to the size of the inductor package and the inductance value. When selecting, it is best to choose an inductor with a smaller DCR.

Relationship between inductance value, size, and DCR:

- For inductors with the same inductance value, the smaller the size, the larger the DCR.
- For inductors with the same size, the larger the inductance value, the larger the DCR.
- For inductors with the same inductance value, those with magnetic shielding have a smaller DCR than those without magnetic shielding.

#### Self-Resonant Frequency SRF

Due to the existence of parasitic capacitance of the inductor, LC oscillation will occur. Like capacitors, the inductor can only exhibit its characteristics at a specific frequency. According to empirical values, SRF is generally 10 times the signal frequency, and the inductor characteristics can be better exhibited at this frequency.

#### Inductor Saturation Current Isat

The direct current that can pass through the inductor when the inductance value drops by 30%.

#### Inductor Temperature Rise Current Irms

The direct current that can pass through the inductor when the temperature of the inductor rises by 40â„ƒ in a 20â„ƒ environment.

Generally, the smaller value between Isat and Irms is taken as the rated current of the inductor, and this rated current should be 1.3 times the maximum output current in the circuit, leaving some margin for derating.

### Magnetic Shielding Characteristics

In general, the shielding characteristics are: E-shaped < semi-shielded < fully molded.

## ðŸš§ Beads

Beads are a type of inductor-based EMI noise filter, which looks and acts like an inductor. Its equivalent model can be simplified as a series connection of an inductor and a resistor. The unit of beads is ohm, and depending on the model, it can suppress noise in several MHz-GHz range. They are often used in signal lines and power lines (in series).

The unit of beads is ohm (Î©), and the unit of inductance is henry (H). Beads are made of ferrite, while inductors are made of a magnetic core and a coil. Beads convert AC signals into heat energy, while inductors store AC signals and release them slowly. Therefore, inductors are energy storage devices, while beads are energy conversion (consumption) devices.

Beads mainly solve the problem of radiation interference. Beads are often used in signal lines, and some high-frequency circuits such as RF, oscillation circuits, DDR SDRAM, etc. need to be equipped with beads in the power input section. Inductors mainly solve the problem of conducted interference. High-frequency inductors are mainly used in low-frequency filtering circuits, RF matching, etc., and power inductors are mainly used in DC-DC circuits.

### Main Parameters of Beads

- **Impedance Z**: The larger the impedance, the better the noise suppression effect. (Generally tested under conditions of 100 MHz)
- **Direct Current Resistance DCR**: The resistance value presented by the bead when the direct current flows through it. The smaller the DCR, the less attenuation of the useful signal.
- **Rated Current**: The maximum current allowed when the bead is working normally.
