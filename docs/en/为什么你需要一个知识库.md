# Why You Need a Knowledge Base

Since 2015, I have been trying to build a personal website. After experiencing various platform changes, I have built a personal knowledge base on [**Power's Wiki**](https://wiki-power.com/) to record and share knowledge. In this article, I will elaborate on the topic in detail.

## Why do you need a knowledge base?

**Knowledge needs to be archived and precipitated**. The knowledge we accumulate through learning will be forgotten quickly if not sorted and summarized in a timely manner. Reasonable classification and archiving are not only conducive to future retrieval and reference, but also help to avoid pitfalls in the same place.

**Use output to drive input**. The best way to quickly master a subject is to restate it in your own words to someone else. If you can describe the knowledge clearly, then you have truly mastered it. With continuous output, when you cannot describe knowledge clearly, you will supplement it through active learning. From another perspective, this also promotes us to constantly read and input.

**Cyberspace paradise**. In this self-contained space, you can avoid the disputes on the mainstream Internet (referring to some smoky remarks). I often regard my personal knowledge base as a paradise where I can calm down and cultivate.

## Why should a knowledge base be public?

**More refined output and organization**. If the knowledge base is not public, the requirements will be lower. Our summary and organization of knowledge may gradually become casual and not pay much attention to standardization and readability. Over time, the knowledge base will gradually become a draft box, and you may not even understand what you wrote before.

**Sharing sparks ideas**. Knowledge needs to be shared, and new sparks may appear in the collision. When others encounter the same problem, they can also directly send the tutorial they have written, which is both convenient and cool.

**Enhance personal brand and meet like-minded people**. By continuously maintaining a knowledge base, you will gain readers and friends who share the same interests. Perhaps they are also interested in photography, programming, circuitry, robotics, reading, etc., and are also managing a knowledge base or blog. In addition, linking the knowledge base to various social platform homepages or resumes is definitely a way to showcase personal strength.

## Why choose to build your own knowledge base?

The relative face of a self-built knowledge base is writing on a third-party platform. Third-party platforms refer to platforms such as Yuque, Zhihu, Jianshu, WeChat public account, CSDN, etc. On these platforms, you don't have to worry about how the underlying construction is done, how basic functions are implemented, how article images are stored, how to deploy site updates and articles, how to do SEO, etc. You just need to write down the text, and the rest is done by the platform. In short, you can write in a foolproof way, and the platform has huge traffic. Since it is so convenient, why do we still advocate building our own knowledge base?

First, there is a **data security** issue. The ownership of the text you leave on a third-party platform does not belong to you.

At this stage of Internet development, most platforms are building walls. They will accept data import, but if you want to migrate data in batches, they will set up obstacles. In addition, many platforms will prevent external links, which is intended to retain users and prevent traffic from flowing to other platforms, but this is very unfavorable for knowledge exchange and collision.

In particular, for WeChat public accounts, as of now, the maximum number of characters that can be edited or deleted in an article is only 20. As we all know, many knowledge is not static and needs to be updated continuously, which is not conducive to the iterative update of knowledge.

Completely entrusting data to the platform is a very insecure behavior. When sensitive content appears in your article or negative comments about the platform, their common practice is to ban and require editing. If the platform's server is hacked or the platform goes bankrupt one day, they are not obligated to restore and return your data. In the final analysis, entrusting to the platform means that you do not have complete control over your data.

Secondly, there is a **customizability** issue. If you choose a platform, you must accept its style and UI, and sometimes you have to tolerate various advertisements in the corners of the article. In contrast, a self-built platform allows for complete customization of the UI. A clean and concise layout undoubtedly improves the reading experience.

In the end, the relationship between third-party and self-built is like renting a house and buying a house. Choosing to rent a house, you can pay less, move in more conveniently, and decorate the house you rent in limited freedom. But what you have is the right to use, not ownership; buying a house, you can change the decoration style at will, and you can stack whatever you want in the room. You have ownership of it.

## Why a knowledge base instead of an article stream?

An article stream refers to the form of blogs, public accounts, and most platforms, which mainly archives articles based on timelines. In contrast, the form of a knowledge base (Wiki) mainly collects articles by category, like browsing a file, which is more conducive to retrieval and classified reading.

Why use a knowledge base instead of an article stream? First of all, some trivial but essential knowledge is not suitable for standalone articles or lengthy discussions. If presented in the form of an article stream, its weight is the same as other articles, which dilutes the purity of the entire site. However, systematic articles grow from these scattered pieces of knowledge. Relatively speaking, using a knowledge base as a carrier in the form of categories is more appropriate.

On the other hand, I previously mentioned in the article "Card-style Writing" that each piece of basic knowledge is equivalent to a small card, which is abstracted layer by layer. Different top-level articles can call the same bottom-level card, which improves the reuse rate of knowledge and reduces redundant work.

## Tool Selection

As for the selection of a knowledge base, the main points I value are:

- **Basic functions**: The sidebar can display article titles and their categories, the main page displays article content, the content supports Markdown syntax, and the content is independent of the framework.
- **Search function**: The search function is a supplement to category archives. Sometimes, it is not convenient to search for a specific knowledge point by category, but with a site-wide search, you can go directly to the point.
- **Project open source**: The platform for the knowledge base must be open source because closed-source projects may stop updating or supporting due to the personal or team reasons of the maintainer, and bugs may not be resolved in a timely manner (this specifically refers to GitBook and Bitcron).
- **Static website**: Static websites can be hosted on platforms such as GitHub Pages without the need to purchase a separate server, which is cost-effective and easy to maintain, and is also SEO-friendly.
- **Easy to set up, deploy, and update**: The establishment of a knowledge base should not take too much time, and the content update process should not be too complicated.
- **Simple and beautiful UI**: For the reading experience, the UI layout should be kept clean and beautiful, and it is best to have a night mode.

## Limitations of Self-built Knowledge Base

> When I see that others only praise a platform without criticism, do not mention certain issues of the platform, have selective blindness, and overly praise certain advantages, all the praise is passionate and irrational... I raise my vigilance and force myself not to be emotionally driven, and rationally look at everything about this platform.

I do not want everyone to only understand the advantages of a self-built knowledge base. It needs to be pointed out that there are certain limitations to self-built knowledge bases. Only by fully understanding their pros and cons can you make choices based on your own purposes.

**Traffic issues**: Relying on third-party platforms, the content you produce is more likely to be read by others and more likely to be displayed in the top ten of search engine results. Relatively speaking, self-built platforms generally have low traffic, which means there are not many readers. However, we can use the method of "one article, multiple publications" to solve this problem. In short, based on the knowledge base, use tools such as Artipub to synchronize content to various third-party platforms and guide traffic to personal knowledge bases.

**Self-built knowledge bases have a certain technical threshold**: For readers who have not been exposed to the Jamstack (JavaScript, API & Markup) concept and its related technology chains, they may need to go through some learning. I will explain this issue in detail in the article "Building a Personal Knowledge Base - Based on Docusaurus."

**Static websites do not have online editors**: In other words, if you choose a static website, the editor and the website itself are separate, and you cannot directly edit and publish content on its webpage or app like on Zhihu. You need a local editor, such as VS Code or Typora. However, there are solutions, which can be found in the article "How to Run VS Code on iPad."

**Knowledge points can belong to multiple categories at the same time**. Generally speaking, knowledge bases only include articles in categories, and to avoid clutter, a single article can only belong to one category. But for example, the article [**How to design the minimum system of a single-chip microcomputer**](https://wiki-power.com/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%BE%E5%8D%95%E7%89%87%E6%9C%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E5%B0%8F%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F) belongs to both the `circuit design` category and the `STM32` category. How should it be included? My solution is to include it in the category that is more relevant to the content of the article. The reason why I don't use a tagging system is that tags are prone to proliferation, and searching is not as convenient as categorization plus search function.

## What platforms have I used?

- **WordPress**: Easy to use but the underlying system is too large and complex, requiring the use of a database, which is not conducive to migration.
- **Hexo**: More complicated and there is no good-looking Wiki theme.
- **GitBook**: The CLI version has stopped updating support, and the V2 version is slow to access in China.
- **Jekyll**: The technology is relatively old and lacks update support.
- **GitHub Issues/Gist/Wiki**: Slow to access in China, and the UI cannot be customized.
- **Bitcron**: Hosts dynamic websites, with poor customizability and variable access speeds.
- **DokuWiki**: Requires a self-owned server and is too old-fashioned.
- **Gridea**: Easy to deploy, but poor customizability and can only be used with its dedicated editor.
- **wiki.js**: Requires a self-owned server to build and is generally suitable for team knowledge bases, but there are some minor issues.
- **Yuque**: A relatively good third-party knowledge base platform, but the UI cannot be customized and data migration is not convenient.
- **Hugo**: Fast deployment speed, but there is no good-looking Wiki theme.
- **Gatsby**: Similar to Hugo.
- **Ghost**: A dynamic website with a beautiful UI, but requires a self-owned server (or paid service) and has poor customizability.
- **docsify**: Relatively recommended. Easy to deploy, beautiful UI, but because of its feature of rendering content during loading, it runs poorly on some devices.
- **Docute**: Relatively recommended. Easy to deploy, beautiful UI, and renders content during loading, but has fewer plugins than docsify.
- **VuePress**: Relatively recommended. All aspects are relatively good, with many community plugins, but the official documentation is messy and there are some minor bugs.
- **Docusaurus**: Relatively recommended. All aspects are relatively good, but the compilation is slow and the framework is relatively bloated.
- **MkDocs (with Material theme)**: Relatively recommended. All aspects are relatively good, and the compilation is relatively fast. This is the solution my website currently uses.
