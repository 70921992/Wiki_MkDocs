# Basic Components - Resistors

## Selection of Resistors

Generally, the following four factors should be considered:

- **Resistance Value**: determined by the specific needs of the application circuit
- **Precision**: usually 1%, if used in current detection circuits (Rsense), lower resistance values and higher power ratings provide higher precision
- **Rated Power**: meets 50% derating, different packages correspond to different power ratings as shown in the table below
- **Size**: size is related to power rating, and should be determined based on power and processing difficulty
- **Operating Temperature, Humidity, etc.**: factors that need to be considered in specific situations
- **Temperature Coefficient**: must be considered if used in high-precision applications (sensor applications)

## Resistance Values of Resistors

### Marking Methods

- **Three-digit Marking Method**: $XXY = XX * 10^Y$
  - For example, for a resistor marked with 272, the actual resistance value is $27 * 10^2=27 * 100=2.7k$
- **Four-digit Marking Method**: $XXXY = XXX * 10^Y$
- **Letter Marking Method for Decimal Point Position**: `R` represents the decimal point.
  - For example, for a resistor marked with 5R6, the actual resistance value is 5.6 Ω
  - `M`, `k`, and `m` can also represent the decimal point, representing `MΩ`, `kΩ`, and `mΩ`, respectively
- **Three-digit Multiplier Code Marking Method**: In `XXY`, `XX` represents the code for the significant digits, and `Y` indicates the power of 10. Refer to the standard resistor value table below for details.
  - For example, for a resistor marked with 01C, the actual resistance value is $100*10^2=10 kΩ$

### Standard Resistor Values

According to the commonly accepted priority standard, the E96 series is generally used more frequently, and its resistance values and multiplier code table are as follows:

## Failure of Resistors

Ranked by the probability of occurrence, they are:

- **Open Circuit**: resistor film defect or degradation; may occur when instantaneous power is too high
- **Resistance Drift Exceeding Specifications**: may occur after aging
- **Pin Breakage**: welding process defects, solder contamination; may occur when the pins of plug-in resistors are repeatedly bent
- **Burnout**: may occur when working at or above the rated power for a long time, leading to open circuit
- **Welding Problems**: such as false welding
- **Wire Breakage**: may occur under mechanical stress or instantaneous over-power shock

## 0 Ohm Resistor Usage

- Used as a jumper to cross areas where wires cannot be placed
- Used as a shorting socket
- Single-point connection of digital ground and analog ground (sometimes also using inductors or magnetic beads)
- Reserved resistance value for debugging

Overcurrent capabilities of 0 ohm resistors of different packages (generally used with a 50% reduction in rated current):

| Package | Rated Current (Max Current)/A |
| :-----: | :--------------------------: |
|  0201   |             0.5(1)            |
|  0402   |              1(2)             |
|  0603   |              2(3)             |
| 0805+   |              2(5)             |

## Usage Scenarios for Resistors

### Voltage Divider Circuit

Resistors are connected in series for voltage division, with the following circuit characteristics:

- The current passing through each resistor is the same, i.e. the current in each resistor is equal, i.e. $I = I_1 = I_2 = I_3$
- The total voltage is equal to the sum of the voltage drops across each resistor, i.e. $V= V_1 + V_2 + V_3$
- The total resistance is equal to the sum of each resistor, i.e. $R=R_1 + R_2 +R_3$

For example, the feedback pin of a voltage regulator is generally connected to a voltage divider circuit consisting of two resistors, which outputs a voltage value close to the internal reference voltage.

### Current Divider Circuit

Resistors are connected in parallel for current division, with the following circuit characteristics:

- The voltage across each branch is equal
- The total current is equal to the sum of the current in each branch, i.e. $I= I_1 + I_2 + I_3$
- The reciprocal of the total resistance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of each branch, i.e. $\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}$

In practical circuit design, it is often used to protect the collector and emitter of a transistor in parallel; in some cases where the power of a linear power regulator is insufficient, a resistor can be added between the input and output to increase the output current.

### Current Limiting Circuit

Generally used for LED current limiting. A resistor is connected in series with the LED circuit to determine the resistance value based on the LED's forward voltage drop (generally 0.7 V) and rated current. It should be noted that the actual operating current calculated is generally less than the rated operating current of the LED.

Current limiting circuits can also be used in hot-swappable circuits.

### Impedance Matching Circuit

The purpose of impedance matching is to allow the load to obtain maximum power, i.e. the load resistance is equal to the signal source resistance. The derivation process is as follows:

Assuming the load resistance is R, the source electromotive force is U, and the internal resistance is r, the current passing through R is:

$$
I=\frac{U}{R+r}
$$

It can be seen that the smaller R is, the larger the current is. The voltage across R is:

$$
U_R=IR=\frac{U}{1+\frac{r}{R}}
$$

The larger R is, the larger the output voltage $U_R$ is. The power of R is:

$$
P=I^2R=(\frac{U}{R+r})^2R=\frac{U^2R}{R^2+r^2+2Rr}=\frac{U^2}{\frac{(R-r)^2}{R}+\frac{4Rr}{R}}
$$

Because r is constant, when R=r, $\frac{(R-r)^2}{R}=0$, and the maximum power $P_{max}=\frac{U^2}{4r}$ can be obtained.

### RC Charging and Discharging Circuit

$\tau=RC$ (if R and C are in units of Ω and F, the result is in units of s).

The RC circuit can be viewed as a delay circuit or a filtering circuit, which filters both the rising and falling edges of the pulse signal, making it smooth. Different rise times can be achieved by adjusting the R and C values.

### Pull-up and Pull-down Circuit

Pull-up is used to clamp an uncertain signal to a high level through a resistor (while also acting as a current limiter); pull-down is the opposite.

Generally, resistors below 50 Ω are strong pull-up/pull-down, and resistors above 100 kΩ are weak pull-up/pull-down.

### Other Circuits

- Peripheral circuit of operational amplifier
- Anti-interference circuit to improve surge voltage resistance
- Load circuit (to prevent circuit from being unloaded)
