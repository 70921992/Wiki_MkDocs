# Communication Protocol - Serial Communication

Serial communication can be considered as the most commonly used and fundamental communication method in microcontrollers. It is often used as a means of debugging, communicating with microcontrollers to monitor data and send commands, and can also be used for communication between two microcontrollers. The physical layer of serial communication is RS-232 and TTL standards.

## Protocol Layer

### Parallel and Serial

- **Parallel Communication**: Each data bit is transmitted simultaneously, which is fast but occupies more pin resources.
- **Serial Communication**: Data is transmitted in bit order, which occupies fewer pin resources but is relatively slow.

### Simplex, Half-duplex, and Full-duplex

- **Simplex**: Data is transmitted in only one direction.
- **Half-duplex**: Data is allowed to be transmitted in both directions, but at the same time, data is only allowed to be transmitted in one direction, which is equivalent to a switchable simplex communication.
- **Full-duplex**: Data is allowed to be transmitted in both directions at the same time. Therefore, full-duplex communication is a combination of two simplex communication methods, which requires independent transmission and reception capabilities for both sending and receiving devices.

### Synchronous and Asynchronous

- **Synchronous Communication**: Transmission with clock synchronization signal. For example, SPI, IIC, and other communication interfaces.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Transmission without clock synchronization signal. For example, UART, single bus.

### USART and UART

- **UART**: Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
- **USART**: Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter

USART is an upgraded version of UART, the difference is that it has an additional CLK line. When there is no signal on CLK, it means that there is no data transmission task. When there is a CLK signal, it is transmitting a signal, and CLK provides clock synchronization function, which is more accurate in verification.

## Physical Layer

### TTL Standard

For TTL standard, please refer to the article [**TTL Level Interface · Communication Protocol - Digital Logic Level**](https://wiki-power.com/en/%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE-%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E9%80%BB%E8%BE%91%E7%94%B5%E5%B9%B3#ttl-%E7%94%B5%E5%B9%B3%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3)

### RS-232 Standard

The physical layer of RS-232 communication is established between the DB9 interfaces of two devices through serial signal lines, and RS-232 level is used to transmit data signals in serial signal lines. Because the controller generally uses TTL level, a dedicated level conversion chip is required to achieve communication.

Comparison of TTL and RS-232 levels:

| Communication Standard | Level Standard (Transmitter)             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 5V TTL                 | Logic `0`: 0~0.5V; Logic `1`: 2.4V-5V    |
| RS-232                 | Logic `0`: +3V~+15V; Logic `1`: -15V~-3V |

The RS-232 protocol generally uses the DB9 interface, with the computer generally using a male connector (pin) and the modem device generally using a female connector (hole):

| Pin Symbol | Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DCD        | Data Carrier Detect | Used by DTE to inform the other party whether the local machine has received the carrier signal from the other party.                                                                                                               |
| RXD        | Receive Data        | Data reception signal, i.e. input.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| TXD        | Transmit Data       | Data transmission signal, i.e. output. The TXD and RXD between two devices should be connected in a cross-over manner.                                                                                                              |
| DTR        | Data Terminal Ready | Used by DTE to inform the other party whether the local machine is ready.                                                                                                                                                           |
| GND        | Signal Ground       | Ground wire. The ground potential between two communication devices may be different, which will affect the level signal of both parties. Therefore, the two serial devices must be connected by a ground wire, i.e. common ground. |
| DSR        | Data Set Ready      | Used by DCE to inform the other party whether the local machine is in standby mode.                                                                                                                                                 |
| RTS        | Request To Send     | DTE requests that DCE send data to the DCE end.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| CTS        | Clear To Send       | DCE responds to the RTS request from the other party, indicating whether the other party can send data.                                                                                                                             |
| RI         | Ring Indicator      | Indicates that the DCE end is connected to the line.                                                                                                                                                                                |

The TX/RX of the DB9 male and female connectors are opposite, so they can be connected directly, which is equivalent to connecting these signal lines:

In serial cables, the RTS, CTS, DSR, DTR, and DCD signals are represented by logic `1` for signal valid and logic `0` for signal invalid.

In practical use, sometimes only RXD, TXD, and GND are retained.
