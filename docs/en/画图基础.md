# Basics of Drawing

## Outline & Mind Map

Tool: [Mubu](https://mubu.com/)

The process of systematizing scattered thoughts.

## Prototype Diagram

Drawing a prototype diagram is a basic skill for product managers. The principle is to highlight the key points of the page in a concise and clear manner. The next step after drawing the prototype diagram is to deliver it to the designer. If the key points cannot be understood directly from the page, it will take a lot of time to communicate verbally, making it difficult to achieve the desired effect.

### Key Principles

- **Use of Fonts**: Use sans-serif fonts as much as possible, and present different sizes and colors according to the importance of the content. Avoid using pure black, and generally use font colors with HEX values of 333333, 666666, 999999, and cccccc.
- **Separation of Operation and Content**: Elements that display content and elements that can be clicked should be clearly distinguished. For clickable elements, system-level standard control styles should be used.
- **Distinct Layout**: Distinguish multiple areas with clear spacing or appropriate white space. In short, people should be able to recognize which area an element belongs to at a glance.
- **Alignment of Elements**: Try to align elements to the left/right/center when placing them.
- **Repetition in Typography**: In typography, it is best to use the same design language between different areas to increase predictability and reduce understanding difficulty.
- **Add Icons and Existing Materials Appropriately**.

## Use Case Diagram

Displays different user roles and describes their corresponding functions. What functions are included in the system and who executes or uses them can be clearly seen from the diagram.

## Flowchart

Tool: Process On, etc.

Generally, rounded rectangles represent the start/end, diamonds represent decisions, and rectangles represent operations and steps, which are sufficient in most cases. For more details, refer to [this article](http://www.sohu.com/a/236178167_505826).

- **Swimlane Diagram**: Displays roles and stages. In practical applications, most of the time, one swimlane represents one role, thus depicting the process relationship between roles.
- **State Transition Diagram**: Compared with ordinary flowcharts, state transition diagrams are more concerned about the next state of each process, rather than when the process ends. It can help developers better understand which states are final states and which states are intermediate states, so as to write code implementations with clearer logic.

## Model Relationship Diagram

Close to database design, reflecting database relationships. Evaluates the complexity of function implementation.

## Framework Diagram

From a relatively long-term perspective, deconstruct the product from a macro perspective. The product framework diagram focuses more on how to solve a problem from a macro perspective, rather than magnifying the functional features required for a certain local area. Therefore, it is more from a retrospective, prospective, and global perspective to output the distribution and relationship between various modules or systems of the product. Therefore, the product architecture diagram is not necessary. Often, it is only necessary to prepare when planning the complete future development plan of the product or retrospectively organizing the structure of a certain system.
