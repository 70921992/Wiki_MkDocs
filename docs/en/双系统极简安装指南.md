# Minimalist Guide to Installing Dual Systems

## Download Ubuntu System Image

Go to <https://cn.ubuntu.com/download> to download the required image.  
Generally, we download the LTS version (long-term support version), which is relatively stable.

## Create a Bootable USB Drive

Download the bootable drive creation tool: [**Rufus**](http://rufus.ie/), and prepare a USB drive with a capacity of 4GB or more.

Select the bootable USB drive and the image to be burned, and choose other configurations as shown in the following figure:

If there are subsequent pop-up steps, select the default option.

## Allocate Disk Space to Ubuntu

Right-click on `This PC` - `Manage`

Select the disk that needs to be allocated space to Ubuntu, right-click and select `Shrink Volume`:

Generally, we allocate 50 GB to 100 GB of capacity to Ubuntu, which is equivalent to 56325 MB to 102400 MB. Enter the set capacity in `Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB` and click OK. The allocated space will appear in black and show as `Unallocated`.

## Install the System

Insert the USB drive and restart the computer. During the startup process, enter the BIOS (the operation to enter the BIOS varies for different brands of computers. For example, mine is to press `F12`) and select the `Install Ubuntu` option.

It is recommended not to connect to the Internet during the installation process, uncheck `Download updates while installing Ubuntu`, and update after the system is installed to avoid slowing down the installation progress.

On the `Installation type` page, select `Something else`, and then select the largest free space disk. Click `+` to create a partition.

First, create the /boot partition. The /boot partition is used to store the system kernel and generally reserves more than 1 GB of space. So we enter `1024` MB in the `Size` column, and `/boot` in the `Mount point` column, and click OK.

Next, create the `/` partition. Similarly, select the free disk, create a partition, and leave the size as the remaining space. Enter `/` in the `Mount point` column and click OK.

The most important step is to select the device where the boot loader will be installed. Select the device corresponding to the /boot partition. This way, the boot loaders of Windows and Ubuntu will not conflict.

Next, select the time zone, and the default can be used. On the `Who are you` page, set personal information, and note that the username and password should be kept relatively simple.

After unplugging the USB drive, restart the computer and select Ubuntu to start in the BIOS.

For post-installation operations, refer to this article: [**Ubuntu Configuration Notes**](https://wiki-power.com/en/Ubuntu%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0).
