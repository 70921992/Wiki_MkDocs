## Electromagnetic Waves and Ultra Short Waves

### Concept of Electromagnetic Waves

Electromagnetic waves are a form of energy transfer. During propagation, the electromagnetic waves are mutually perpendicular in space and also perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

Electromagnetic waves are like waves in a pond and they weaken during propagation.

The propagation speed of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is equal to the speed of light (c, 300,000 km/s). In a non-vacuum environment, the propagation speed is affected by the medium and can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
v=\frac{c}{\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}}
$$

where $\varepsilon$ is the dielectric constant of the propagation medium.

The relationship between the wavelength, frequency, and propagation speed of electromagnetic waves is:

$$
\lambda=\frac{V}{f}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength (m), $V$ is the propagation speed (m/s), and $f$ is the frequency (Hz).

### Polarization of Electromagnetic Waves

The polarization of electromagnetic waves refers to the direction in which the electric field of the waves changes as they propagate in space.

## Antennas

### Polarization of Antennas

The polarization direction of the electric field of the electromagnetic field radiated by an antenna is the polarization direction of the antenna.

### Principles of Antennas

When a conductor carries alternating current, it can generate electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation ability is related to the length and shape of the conductor.

When the length of the conductor increases to be comparable to the wavelength, the current on the conductor increases significantly, which can generate strong radiation. The above-mentioned straight conductor that can produce significant radiation is usually called a radiator.

An antenna is equivalent to a four-terminal network:

If the lengths of the two arms of the radiator are equal, it is called a symmetrical radiator or half-wave radiator:

For example, the length of a symmetrical radiator at 400MHz is approximately 400mm, and the length of a symmetrical radiator at 800MHz is approximately 200mm.

The distribution of various fields on a symmetrical radiator:
