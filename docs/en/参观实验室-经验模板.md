# Visiting the Laboratory - Experience Template

Visiting the laboratory is a necessary activity every year, whether it is for freshmen or leaders. The difference is that for freshmen, we need to be down-to-earth and not involve too much theoretical knowledge. We only need to explain what robots are and what functions they have to make them interested in the laboratory and join us. If they are interested, we can explain in detail from a professional perspective. For leaders, we can directly explain professional knowledge because we represent the school and showcase the technology and professional fields we have mastered.

Most people don't listen carefully to the explanations, they just want to see the machines move.

When visiting the laboratory, the main aspects are as follows:

## S1 Exhibition Area

Optional. Because it is not our own work, there is no need to explain, just attract people by starting it up.

## Award Area

> Our Huagong Robot Wolf Team mainly participates in two competitions, RoboMaster Robotics Competition and ROBOCON National University Robot Competition.
>
> We are a team with scientific research strength. These are the awards we have won in recent years, all of which are national first and second level.
>
> These are photos of our competitions and the team's daily life. Everyone can take a look.

## Infantry Activity Area

The infantry activity area is a horizontal area along the B3-401 outer wall, mainly demonstrating the omnidirectional movement and self-aiming functions of the infantry, and a warning line should be drawn.

> Everyone can come and take a look. This is our infantry robot. Its role in the competition is to launch projectiles and hit the enemy's armor plate to kill the enemy. The whole competition is like playing King of Glory (guiding to watch the video), destroying the enemy's crystal, which we call the base, can win the game.
>
> These are our two infantry robots. As you can see, this one can automatically recognize and aim. This is the task of our visual algorithm group, which is equivalent to writing an aimbot for the robot, so that it can better lock the opponent's robot during the competition.

## Static Display Area

This area can display robots from previous years (non-moving) and drones can also be placed here.

> Everyone, this is our quadruped robot from last year's ROBOCON competition.
>
> This is RoboMaster's hero robot. The difference between it and the infantry is that it launches large projectiles (demonstrated in hand), which is ten times the damage of the infantry's small projectiles.
>
> This is RoboMaster's drone. Its role is to provide us with a bird's-eye view, and it also has the function of shooting projectiles, which can cause damage to the enemy's robots and base.
>
> Everyone can take a look. This is the first-person perspective we have when playing the game, just like playing an FPS game, but controlling the physical robot on the field.

## Engineering, Divine Symbol, Sentinel Area

This vertical area can be cordoned off, and the inside can be displayed to the outside.

> Over here, let's take a look at this robot. It is called an engineering robot, and its role is to pick up ammunition boxes and distribute large and small projectiles to the infantry and hero robots. It can also revive them when they die. So the engineering robot mainly plays the role of a logistics soldier.
>
> Over there, we can see a prop on our competition field. The divine symbol only lights up one fan blade randomly each time. If our infantry robot hits the fan blade that lights up, it can get some buffs like increased attack power.
>
> On the far left is our sentinel robot. Its characteristic is that it runs automatically without human control and can aim and attack enemy robots.
>
> The function of automatic recognition and aiming requires the use of artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms, including the recognition of the divine symbol just now (pointing), which is the responsibility of the visual algorithm group.

## Others

> Regarding our internal grouping, everyone can take a look at the mural on the wall (I will post it tomorrow).
> The mechanical group mainly builds the robots;
> The electrical control group mainly writes and debugs the control code for the robots;
> The visual group mainly writes some plug-ins;
> The hardware circuit group mainly designs and manufactures circuit boards for the robots (let's take a look at the main control board).
> There is also a software group, which writes some practical software for our team, such as the small program we use to manage materials, as well as websites and blogs.
>
> We have a publicity planning group and a finance group in the administrative group. Everyone can also scan the QR code to follow our public account to learn more.
>
> If you want to join the laboratory, we have no threshold. As long as you are interested in us and have passion, you can join us.
>
> Everyone can scan the QR code to follow us, or scan the QR code on the wall to participate in the lucky draw~

Here are some technical contents that can be referred to (do not read them verbatim):

```markdown
S1 Exhibition Area
Introduction: RoboMaster S1 small robot simple movement
Explanation: What we see now is the education robot "RoboMaster S1" released by DJI in June last year. I believe everyone knows about the RoboMaster Robotics Competition. The S1 robot is derived from the RoboMaster competition. Based on the exploration and accumulation in this competition, DJI developed the S1 and promoted it so that everyone can experience the charm of robots. Interested students can try to experience it (mobile app control experience).

Certificate Area
Introduction: Awards won over the years
Explanation: This is the achievement section of our Wolf team since its establishment three years ago. Although the team has not been around for long, our achievements are evident with the first, second, and third prizes displayed here. This shows that our team has a certain level of scientific research strength, and we look forward to your joining us to inject more new energy. (Explaining the certificates)

Infantry Area
Introduction: Omnidirectional movement / Small gyro / Waist twisting, visual recognition
Explanation: This is our infantry robot in the Robomaster competition. The role of the infantry is mainly to attack enemy robots by firing small projectiles. This is the place where the small projectiles are fired (pointing to the location). The infantry has high flexibility and is the most sensitive among all robots. It can move in all directions. Now let's watch it perform a "small gyro rotation" and waist twisting... (demonstration) In addition, the infantry robot can also perform visual recognition, such as self-aiming, which means it can automatically aim at a certain object and follow it.

Static Area
Introduction: Dog / Drone / Display screen playing competition videos
Explanation: What does this robot look like to everyone? Yes, it looks a bit like a dog. This is a type of quadruped robot, which was a participating robot in the previous Robocon competition. And this is an aerial robot, which is also a type of robot. After seeing so many robots, have you refreshed your understanding of the form of robots? You can watch our competition videos to see the functions of these robots.

Engineering Gripper Area
Introduction: Demonstration of engineering gripper grabbing ammunition box
Explanation: This is the No. 2 engineering robot in the RoboMaster competition. As you can see, it looks more square compared to the infantry. Although it does not have a firing mechanism, it will use various special mechanisms to assist other robots on the field. For example, each large projectile with a damage value of 100 needs to be obtained from the ammunition box on the resource island by the engineering robot's gripping mechanism, and after collecting the large projectiles, they will be supplied to the hero robot. When our infantry robots and other ground robots are damaged to the point of being killed in battle, they often stay in the center of the field. At this time, the engineering robot can use its rescue mechanism to drag the infantry robot back to our supply area for resurrection. Different schools will use different mechanisms to achieve actions such as gripping. This vehicle uses a device called a motor to flip the claw for grabbing ammunition, and a cylinder as an executive component to clamp the ammunition box.

Remaining RM Robots
Introduction: Introduction to Sentry, Mobile Hero, and Great Magic Symbol
Explanation: Hero: (pointing to the hero) This robot is the hero robot, whose main role is to attack enemy robots by firing 35mm large projectiles (golf ball size). This is the place where the large projectiles are fired (pointing to the location). It is similar to the infantry robot, but compared to the infantry robot, the hero robot has higher damage and slightly higher health, but lower flexibility and firing speed. If we regard the infantry as a guerrilla with low continuous output and low health, then the hero robot is a warrior with both explosive killing ability and certain toughness, and often organizes attacks with the infantry robot in the competition. Great Magic Symbol: Here we can see the rotating and glowing Great Magic Symbol. In the 20th season, it was officially called the Energy Mechanism. Due to the high difficulty of activating the Great Magic Symbol and the name of the past seasons, most RM participants still call it the Great Magic Symbol. The Great Magic Symbol provides high bonus effects in the competition and requires our infantry robots to activate it in a specific way, directly improving the attack and defense of the infantry hero. The side that activates the Great Magic Symbol first often has a huge advantage in the competition and is an important factor in winning the game (if it sounds like bragging, feel free to change it). The key algorithm required to activate the Great Magic Symbol is responsible by our visual algorithm team members, requiring a solid foundation in mathematical linear algebra and probability theory. For students interested in the Great Magic Symbol or mathematical logic, you can scan the QR code here to watch the visual algorithm team tutorial and learn about signing up for our visual algorithm team. Thank you, everyone! Please continue to visit the next area.

Sentry:
Sentry is the only fully automatic robot in the ROBMASTER Mech Master Competition. It is responsible for defending the base and providing cover for its teammates in specific areas.
In the competition, the Sentry robot is placed on a fixed track between the base and the front line, and moves along the track to seek and destroy enemy ground robots. Although the Sentry is not equipped with an operator, the rules give it one of the highest health and ammunition capacities in the game. It is also equipped with dual barrels, giving it unparalleled firepower and making it a force to be reckoned with on the field. The fact that the Sentry has won the MVP award multiple times in previous competitions proves this. As the smallest and lightest robot in the competition, it is also a powerful new force on the field.
However, to create such a powerful unit is no small challenge. The members of the mechanical team need to think about how to integrate a considerable number of systems into such a small volume while ensuring stability and ensuring that they work together without interference. The members of the electrical control team need to plan the optimal motion plan for it, allowing it to move freely on the small track. The vision team needs to design an automatic aiming program for it, allowing it to hit the target with every shot even without human operation. So, do you want to take on this challenging and fun project?
