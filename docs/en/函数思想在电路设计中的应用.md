# Application of Functionality in Circuit Design

> Design projects from the perspective of building a system, rather than just drawing a circuit board or designing a solution.

## Background

In program design, we encounter various complex data and situations. If left unchecked, as development progresses, the code entropy will increase sharply. Functions and libraries are designed to solve these problems. By encapsulating the code layer by layer, we can obtain a well-ordered system from a global perspective without worrying about any details that we don't need to focus on.

Analogous to hardware circuit design, the bottom-level constituent elements are discrete components, and the modules that implement specific functions are functionally encapsulated. At the global level, various modules can be called to form a circuit solution. The idea of encapsulation and reuse can help us design circuits more systematically and from top to bottom, like building a kingdom.

Note: The term "encapsulation" in the first paragraph is a computer program term, and the term "encapsulation" in the following text is a circuit term.

## Component Level

At the component level, the specifications of each element (component) should also be as uniform as possible. My personal solution is to call all the component symbols/PCB packages that appear in my circuit design from the schematic library/package library that I have personally organized.

Some people may ask, most component symbols and packages can be easily found online, and even more than 90% of the components have been organized into libraries. Why do we need to do repetitive work?  
As the saying goes, the foundation determines the superstructure. For example, what kind of chip symbol is more convenient for wiring, what kind of package is easier to buy for a certain inductor, and what kind of MOS package can have a hole for heat dissipation, etc. Even the standards set by the most powerful people may not be completely applicable to you. Establishing your own standards and building your house on your own land is the wisest approach.

## Functional Module Level

Based on the bottom-level discrete components, we can build different functional modules. The purpose of functional modules is to facilitate rapid development. For example, I often use voltage regulator circuits in many projects. Then I can select the best solution, package it into modules according to the data sheet, leave function interfaces (input/output ports), and label properties (voltage regulator current/efficiency, etc.). When needed, we don't need to care about the internal implementation of the functional module. Like building blocks, we can stack project plans from the top level.

Altium Designer provides us with the function of fragment extraction. We can encapsulate the functional modules we encounter in daily life, making it easy to call them later.

## Project Level

At the project design level, the modularization idea is already obvious. Through the hierarchical schematic design function of Altium Designer, we can focus on the interfaces of each module and directly operate the interfaces to achieve the overall circuit function. In this design mode, the coupling between each module is not high. We can easily replace modules that implement a certain function at any time, or reuse modules through multi-channel functions. A well-organized project is very beneficial for modularized layout and multi-channel wiring reuse in the following PCB design, making it easier for future debugging and updates.
