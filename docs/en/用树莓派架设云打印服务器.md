## Background

Suppose there is a shared printer (not connected to a computer) in the office, and manual switching is required every time you print. Then Raspberry Pi can be used as a print server to achieve shared cloud printing.

## Steps

### 1. Preparations

Flash Raspbian system on Raspberry Pi, and it is recommended to change to a domestic software source.

### 2. Configure Cloud Printing Service

Install CUPS plugin:

```shell
sudo apt-get install cups
sudo cupsctl --remote-any
sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart
```

View the current IP address of Raspberry Pi:

```
$hostname -I
```

Now you can enter in the browser:

```
https://your Raspberry Pi IP:631/
```

Open the CUPS interface. The browser may pop up a warning, just ignore it.

Jump to the Administration interface, pay attention to the check on the right:

Add a printer:

Connect the printer to Raspberry Pi with a USB cable. Generally, you can see the local USB device: ![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/dOY25IVr55cf4qbg__thumbnail-1.png)

Directly add the device, the name should be as simple as possible, and the share option must be checked: ![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/zY62367hBa0ZuwJV__thumbnail.png)

Find the corresponding model of the printer, and then just click it. After the configuration is completed, you can select `Print Test Page` on the printer page to test whether it can print normally:

### 3. Configuration on Windows

Control Panel - Devices and Printers - Add Printer

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/CRkgxClLaaYjdGPt__thumbnail.png)

Enter the IP, for example:

```
http://your Raspberry Pi IP:631/printers/the name of the printer set just now
```

Try printing a test page?

## Summary

If you repeat something more than twice, you can consider using an automated process to solve it. Learn to use smart methods to be lazy.
