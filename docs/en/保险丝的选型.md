# Selection of Fuses

## General Selection

- Voltage rating (maximum voltage): should be greater than the voltage of the power supply, with appropriate margin.
- Rated current: should be greater than the normal operating current (rated current is not the melting current).
- Operating temperature: leave a margin of at least 25%.
- Voltage drop/cold resistance: generally, the smaller the better (less power loss).
- Fuse characteristic: the main electrical performance index of the fuse. It indicates that when the current exceeds the limit, the temperature of the fuse gradually rises until the fuse is burned out. According to different fuse characteristics, fuses can be divided into fast-acting and time-delay types. Time-delay fuses are commonly used in inductive or capacitive circuits with large surge currents during circuit state changes, and can withstand the impact of surge pulses during switching on and off; fast-acting fuses are commonly used in resistive circuits to protect components that are particularly sensitive to current fluctuations.
- Breaking capacity: indicates the maximum current that the fuse can safely cut off under the specified voltage.

## PPTC Selection

Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient (PPTC) fuses have a very low resistance (low voltage drop) when operating normally. When the circuit experiences overcurrent and its temperature rises, the resistance increases sharply by several orders of magnitude, reducing the current in the circuit to a safe value, thereby protecting the subsequent circuit. After the overcurrent disappears, the PPTC fuse automatically recovers to its low-resistance state, avoiding the trouble of frequently replacing the current fuse.

Parameters:

- Maximum voltage $V_{max}$ (Rated Voltage): the maximum voltage that can be withstood under the rated current.
- Maximum current $I_{max}$ (Maximum Current): the maximum current that can be withstood under the rated voltage.
- Hold current $I_{hold}$ (Hold Current): the maximum current that does not cause action (does not cause a sudden change in resistance).
- Trip current $I_{trip}$ (Trip Current): the minimum current that causes action (causes a sudden change in resistance), generally twice the hold current.
- Operating power $P_d$ (Typical power): the power consumption in the operating state.
- Maximum trip time $T_{trip}$ (Max Time to Trip): the maximum trip time under the specified current.
- Static resistance $R_{i_{min/max}}$ (Resistance Tolerance): initial resistance value before welding.
- Resistance after one hour of welding $R_{1_{max}}$: maximum resistance value after one hour of welding/tripping.
