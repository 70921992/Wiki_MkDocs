# Signal Integrity - Time Domain and Frequency Domain

Generally speaking, we analyze signals from two perspectives: time domain and frequency domain.

## Time Domain

The time domain is the domain that exists in the real world and presents itself in chronological order. For example, in the time domain graph of a clock signal, we can observe two important parameters: the waveform period and the rising edge:

The clock period is the time it takes for the signal to repeat itself once, usually measured in nanoseconds. The clock frequency is the number of cycles per second, which is the reciprocal of the period. For example, for a clock signal with a period of 1ns, the frequency is 1/10ns=0.1GHz.

The rising edge is usually defined as the time it takes for the signal to transition from 20% to 80% of its highest point (sometimes defined as 10% to 90%). The falling edge is usually shorter than the rising edge because in a typical CMOS structure, N-MOS conducts faster than P-MOS, resulting in a shorter falling edge and a higher likelihood of signal integrity issues.

## Frequency Domain

The frequency domain is a domain that exists in mathematical definitions. Sinusoidal waves are commonly used in the frequency domain because any waveform in the time domain can be synthesized using sinusoidal waves.

The frequency domain can describe the same information more concisely. As shown in the figure below, the left side shows the description of a sinusoidal wave in the time domain, which can be fully represented by three parameters: frequency, amplitude, and phase. The right side shows the description in the frequency domain, where frequency and amplitude can be represented by a single point (phase is often ignored in most cases):

Thus, a sinusoidal wave can be represented by a single point in the frequency domain. If there are multiple frequency points, the collection is called a spectrum.

Describing general electrical problems in the frequency domain using sinusoidal waves makes them easier to understand and solve.

## Transformation from Time Domain to Frequency Domain

The transformation from the time domain to the frequency domain is achieved through Fourier transform. There are three types of Fourier transforms: Fourier integral (FI), discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and fast Fourier transform (FFT).

Fourier integral is used to transform an ideal mathematical expression in the time domain into a frequency domain representation. It integrates the time axis of the time domain from negative infinity to positive infinity to obtain a continuous frequency domain function from zero to positive infinity.

However, in reality, the waveform in the time domain is composed of a series of discrete points. In this case, using discrete Fourier transform can transform the waveform into the frequency domain (assuming the time domain is periodic). Unlike Fourier integral, Fourier transform can be achieved by summation.

Fast Fourier transform uses fast matrix algebraic methods and is only applicable when the number of data points in the time domain is a power of 2 (such as 256, 512, 1024 points). Depending on the number of calculation points, the calculation speed can be much faster than that of ordinary discrete Fourier transform.

It should be noted that fast Fourier transform requires the signal to be periodically repeated, so the original signal needs to be coherently sampled or windowed after sampling.

## Inverse Transformation from Frequency Domain to Time Domain

The frequency domain contains the frequency and amplitude of all sinusoidal wave components in the waveform. To obtain the time domain waveform, we only need to inverse transform each frequency component by multiplying it with its corresponding sinusoidal wave in the time domain and then add them up. This process is called Fourier inverse transform.

A square wave is a superposition of multiple harmonic components of sinusoidal waves. The more components are superimposed, the steeper the rising edge and the closer it is to an ideal square wave:

## Bandwidth and Rising Edge

Bandwidth represents the highest **effective** sinusoidal wave frequency component value in the spectrum (because in digital signals, the lowest frequency is always DC), representing the frequency range in the signal spectrum. The choice of bandwidth has a direct impact on the shortest rising edge of the time domain waveform. Taking an ideal square wave as an example, the larger the bandwidth, the shorter the rising edge, and the waveform is closer to an ideal square wave.

Note that "effective" means that the harmonic amplitude of the signal is higher than 70% of the corresponding harmonic amplitude in the same fundamental frequency ideal square wave.

For example, if only the 0th, 1st, and 3rd harmonic components are used to synthesize the time domain waveform, the bandwidth of the waveform is the value of the 3rd harmonic, which is 3GHz.

According to the empirical rule obtained from experiments, the relationship between bandwidth and rise time is $BW=\frac{0.35}{RT}$, where BW is the bandwidth (GHz) and RT is the 10%-90% rise time (ns). For example, if the rise time of a signal is 0.1 ns, then the bandwidth of the signal is 0.35 GHz, and vice versa. (Note the corresponding units, GHz corresponds to ns, and MHz corresponds to us).
