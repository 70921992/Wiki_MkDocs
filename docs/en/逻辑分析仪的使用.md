# Using a Logic Analyzer ðŸš§

Unlike an oscilloscope, a logic analyzer only measures the voltage levels of digital signals.

The way a logic analyzer measures and analyzes signals is different from an oscilloscope. A logic analyzer does not measure analog details, but instead detects logic threshold levels. The logic analyzer only looks for two logic levels, where the voltage level is considered `high` or `1` when it is above the threshold voltage (threshold), and `low` or `0` when it is below the threshold. When the logic analyzer samples the input, it outputs `0` or `1` based on the signal level relative to the voltage threshold.
