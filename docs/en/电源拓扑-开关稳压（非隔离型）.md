# Power Supply Topology - Switching Regulator (Non-Isolated)

Switching power supply is a type of power supply that uses the time ratio of electronic switches to maintain a stable output voltage. Modern switching power supplies generally consist of pulse width modulation (PWM) control ICs and MOSFETs.

## Basic Concepts of Switching Regulators

- Time for a complete cycle: $T_{s}$
- Time for electronic switch to turn on: $T_{on}$
- Duty cycle $\delta=\frac{T_{on}}{T_{s}}$

Volt-second balance of inductance: For a stable inductance, the volt-seconds during the on-time (current rising segment) of the electronic switch must be numerically equal to the volt-seconds during the off-time (current falling segment).

Equal power principle: Without considering efficiency, the input power of a switching power supply is equal to the output power, which is equivalent to the product of input voltage and current, and is equal to the product of output voltage and current. Intuitively, a buck converter can provide a larger current than the input, while the output current of a boost converter is smaller than the input current.

## Main Components and Characteristics of Switching Regulators

The main components used in switching regulators are electronic switches, inductors, and capacitors.

### Electronic Switches

The requirement for electronic switches is to achieve fast switching, and the faster the better. Commonly used electronic switches include transistors, power MOS tubes, or IGBT tubes.

### Inductors

As an energy storage component, inductors are used in DC-DC converters to smooth current (hence also called choke coils). The characteristic of the current flowing through the inductor is that it has magnetic flux continuity (which can be understood as inertia). Under normal circumstances, the inductor works in its linear region, where the inductance value is constant and does not change with the terminal voltage and the current flowing through it. Inductors have the following characteristics:

1. When a current $I$ flows through an inductor $L$, it stores $\frac{1}{2}LI^2$ energy.
2. When the voltage $V$ across an inductor $L$ is constant, because $V=L\frac{di}{dt}$, ignoring internal resistance, the rate of change of the inductor current is $\frac{di}{dt}=\frac{V}{L}$, which is a linear increase in the inductor current.
3. For an inductor that is storing energy, if the original circuit is suddenly disconnected, the inductor will maintain the magnetic field, that is, the current cannot change instantaneously, or the volt-second value remains unchanged.

The power stored in an inductor can be expressed as:

$$
P(L)=\frac{LI^2f}{2}
$$

It can be seen that the power stored in an inductor is proportional to the switching frequency. If the switching frequency is doubled, the size of the inductor can be halved.

### Capacitors

Capacitors are also used in DC-DC converters to store and transfer electrical energy, but unlike inductors, they are mainly used to absorb ripple and smooth the voltage waveform, making the output voltage stable. They are also called output capacitors.

The power stored in a capacitor can be expressed as:

$$
P(C)=\frac{CV^2f}{2}
$$

Similarly to inductors, capacitors can be made smaller by increasing the switching frequency. However, it should be noted that the higher the switching frequency, the higher the noise generated, so a balance needs to be struck between size and frequency.

### Diodes

In non-synchronous DC-DC converters, we use diodes to provide a current path for the inductor when the switch is turned off, so they are also called freewheeling diodes. In synchronous DC-DC converters, electronic switches are used instead of freewheeling diodes.

## Non-Isolated DC-DC Topology

In non-isolated DC-DC topology, the input source and the output load share the same current path.

Using electronic switches, inductors, capacitors, and diodes, the simplest PWM-type DC-DC converter can be constructed. There are mainly three types: buck, boost, and buck-boost, which will be explained in detail below. In addition, there are also double-ended buck-boost converters (Cuk), and single-ended primary-inductor converters (SEPIC), which are less commonly used and will not be described in detail.

### Buck

Buck converters convert a higher voltage to a stable lower voltage. The topology is as follows:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211214100156.png)

Note: The switch $S_1$ in the figure is actually an electronic switch (such as a power MOS tube), but it is simplified to a regular switch for ease of understanding.

Basic principle:

1. Switch S1 is closed (blue solid line)
   - At this time, diode D1 is cut off, and the current passes through inductor L1 to supply power to the load RL, while storing energy in inductor L1 and capacitor C1. Before the inductor coil is saturated, the current increases linearly (the current in the inductor cannot change abruptly), and the output voltage cannot immediately reach the input voltage value.
   - The forward volt-second of the inductor at this time is: $(V_{in}-V_{out})* T_{on}$
2. Switch S1 is opened (green dashed line)
   - Due to the self-inductive inertia of inductor L, the direction and magnitude of its current cannot change abruptly. At this time, the current will flow through the circuit provided by the freewheeling diode D1 to continue to supply power to the output load. At the same time, capacitor C1 also participates in discharging.
   - The reverse volt-second of the inductor at this time is: $V_{out} * T_{off}$

According to the inductor volt-second balance (i.e., energy conservation), $(V_{in}-V_{out})* T_{on}=V_{out} * T_{off}$, we can get:

$$
V_{out}=\delta*V_{in}
$$

The waveform curves of each node are as follows:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211214100812.png)

By controlling the duty cycle of PWM, the electronic switch S1 is continuously closed and opened, and the input current is pulsating. However, through the joint action of inductors, capacitors, and diodes, the output current is relatively continuous and stable.

### Boost

Boost can convert a lower voltage into a stable higher voltage. Its topology is as follows:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211214100041.png)

Basic principle:

1. Switch S1 is closed (blue solid line)
   - The current flows through inductor L1. Before the inductor is saturated, the current increases linearly at a rate of $\frac{V_{in}}{L_1}$, and the energy is stored in the inductor in the form of magnetic energy. At this time, capacitor C1 supplies power to the load RL. Assuming that the voltage at both ends of the load at this time is $V_0$. Because switch S1 is closed, diode D1 anode is grounded, and the charge released by capacitor cannot pass through the diode.
   - The forward volt-second of the inductor at this time is: $V_{in}* T_{on}$
2. Switch S1 is opened (green dashed line)
   - Because the current on inductor L1 cannot change abruptly, the magnetic energy on the inductor is converted into voltage output current, which decreases linearly at a rate of $\frac{V_{out}-V_{in}}{L_1}$, and is connected in series with the power supply $V_{in}$ to supply power to capacitor C1 and load RL. When the series voltage is higher than $V_0$, capacitor C1 is in a charging state; when the series voltage is equal to $V_0$, the charging current is zero; when $V_0$ is decreasing, the capacitor discharges to maintain $V_0$ unchanged.
   - The reverse volt-second of the inductor at this time is: $(V_{out}-V_{in})* T_{off}$

According to the inductor volt-second balance $V_{in}* T_{on}=(V_{out}-V_{in})* T_{off}$, we can get:

$$
V_{out}=\frac{\delta}{1-\delta}*V_{in}
$$

(This is only valid when $V_{in}<V_{out}$)

The waveform curves of each node are as follows:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211214103137.png)

Because the load voltage $V_0$ in series is higher than the original $V_{in}$, it can achieve boost.

### Buck-Boost

Buck-Boost can convert an input voltage into a stable output voltage that is inverted and can be higher or lower than the input voltage. Its topology is as follows:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211214100108.png)

Basic principle:

1. Switch $S_1$ is closed (blue solid line)
   - The current flows through inductor $L_1$, and before the inductor saturates, the current linearly increases at a rate of $\frac{V_{in}}{L_1}$; diode $D_1$ is reverse-biased, blocking the current from the power supply to the load. The energy stored in capacitor $C_1$ during this time supplies power to the load.
   - At this time, the forward voltage drop across the inductor is: $V_{in}* T_{on}$
2. Switch $S_1$ is opened (green dashed line)
   - Since the current in inductor $L_1$ cannot change abruptly, it linearly decreases at a rate of $\frac{V_{out}}{L_1}$, so the current flows through the green dashed line loop, supplying power to the load and charging capacitor $C_1$, while diode $D_1$ is forward-biased. The current flowing through the inductor decreases linearly. Since the current flows in the opposite direction, the output voltage is negative with respect to ground, so the output of this topology is inverted.
   - At this time, the reverse voltage drop across the inductor is: $-V_{out}* T_{off}$

According to the inductor voltage drop balance $V_{in}* T_{on}=-V_{out}* T_{off}$, we can obtain:

$$
V_{out}=\frac{-\delta}{1-\delta}*V_{in}
$$

Waveform curves of each node:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211214171652.png)

The advantage of a buck-boost converter is that the input voltage can be lower or higher than the regulated output voltage. It can be used in battery-powered circuits, such as when a system requires a 12V power supply, and the battery is fully charged at 13V or depleted at 11V.

## Continuous and discontinuous modes of Buck and Boost

Continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) refer to whether the current in the inductor will drop to 0. If the load is large, the current in the inductor will not drop to 0, and it is called continuous mode. Conversely, if the load is small and the converter has enough time to fully charge the output capacitor, the current in the inductor will drop to 0 during the remaining time. When a new cycle begins, the current in the inductor will start to increase linearly from 0, which is called discontinuous mode.

The critical state between continuous and discontinuous modes is $\frac{1}{2}\Delta i_L=I_{out}$. When $\frac{1}{2}\Delta i_L<I_out$, it is continuous mode; otherwise, it is discontinuous mode.

In the case of low load, the transition from continuous mode to discontinuous mode will cause a change in the input-output voltage relationship:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211215091306.png)

Therefore, to keep working in continuous mode, many buck-boost controllers choose to increase their operating frequency at low loads.

## Synchronous and asynchronous conversion

The difference between synchronous and asynchronous refers to whether a diode or a MOSFET is used as the rectifier (freewheeling) device. As shown in the figure below, the left is asynchronous, and the right is synchronous:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220702165541.png)

In synchronous mode, the start signal of the MOSFET must be out of phase with the PWM signal.

The advantage of synchronous mode over asynchronous mode is that the MOSFET has a small $R_{DS(on)}$ and a small forward voltage drop, which results in higher efficiency at high current and ground input voltage. Moreover, the package of high-power MOSFETs is generally smaller than that of power diodes, so it can save space.

The disadvantage of synchronous mode compared to asynchronous mode is that it brings additional driving circuits and timing circuits to prevent both MOSFETs from turning on at the same time, which increases the cost. In addition, at low loads, the charging and discharging of the MOSFET gate capacitance will generate additional power consumption, so the efficiency is actually lower than that of asynchronous mode.
