# Smith Chart and Matching Circuit Basics

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220601144205.jpg)

The Smith Chart is a polar plot of the complex reflection coefficient (gamma $\Gamma$). This chart simultaneously plots the real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance. The range of the real part R is from 0 to infinity ($\infty$), and the range of the imaginary part X is from negative infinity to positive infinity, all of which can be plotted on a single chart. The parameters and functions that can be represented by the Smith Chart include, but are not limited to:

- Complex impedance
- Complex reflection coefficient
- Voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR)
- Transmission line effects
- Design of impedance matching networks

## Normalized Impedance

We first need to convert the complex impedance to normalized impedance before plotting it on the Smith Chart. The normalized impedance is equal to the **actual impedance** divided by the **system impedance**:

$$
Normalized Z=\frac{Actual Z}{System Z_0}
$$

In most cases, the system impedance is 50Ω, so the normalized impedance is basically the actual impedance divided by 50Ω. For example, if the actual impedance value is (37+j55)Ω, the value of the normalized impedance is approximately (0.74+j1.10)Ω.

## Detailed Explanation of the Smith Chart

On the Smith Chart, the horizontal axis in the middle is the pure resistance axis (R). On this axis, the reactance is always 0. In the region above the main axis (R+jX), the reactance is inductive, while in the region below the main axis (R-jX), the reactance is capacitive.

### Key Points

There are some key points on the Smith Chart. The central point represents the system impedance (in a 50Ω impedance system, this central point represents an impedance value of 50Ω). Along the main axis, the rightmost point represents an open circuit (infinite impedance), and the leftmost point represents a short circuit (impedance of 0).

### Constant Resistance Circles

On the constant resistance circles, the normalized resistance (real part) is constant. For example, the circle passing through the center point has a resistance of 1 (50Ω), which means the real part of the normalized impedance is 1. In the diagram, there are also constant resistance circles with normalized resistance values of 0.4 and 3.0:

### Constant Reactance Arcs

The constant reactance arcs extend from the open circuit point, and the points on the arc represent the value of reactance, which is the imaginary part of the complex impedance. The larger the arc, the larger the absolute value of the reactance. As the arc becomes smaller, the absolute value of the reactance becomes smaller until it becomes 0 (falling on the pure resistance axis, showing neither inductive nor capacitive behavior). In the diagram, there are constant reactance arcs with reactance values of ±0.5 (imaginary part ±j0.5) and ±1.0 (imaginary part ±j1.0):

### Converting Complex Impedance to Complex Admittance

Admittance (Y) is the reciprocal of impedance, conductance (G) is the reciprocal of resistance, and susceptance (B) is the reciprocal of reactance. If they are complex numbers, the calculations can be very complicated. However, on the Smith Chart, we only need to draw a circle passing through the point of complex impedance Z' with the center point as the center, and we can find the corresponding complex admittance value Y' on the other side of the circle.

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220601103327.png)

For example, if Z'=1+j1.1, then its corresponding Y'=0.45-j0.5.

If it is a curve of complex impedance, the Smith Chart can be rotated 180° to obtain the curve of complex admittance.

### Constant Conductance Circles and Constant Susceptance Arcs

On the complete Smith Chart, there are also **constant conductance circles** and **constant susceptance arcs**, marked in blue in the following diagram:

### Marking General Values on the Smith Chart

To mark general values on the Smith Chart, such as Z=25+j40. First, we normalize it with a 50Ω impedance, and calculate Z'=0.5+j0.8. From this, we can find the circle with R'=0.5 and the arc with X'=0.8 on the chart, and their intersection is the desired Z'.

### Radial Scaling Parameters of Smith Chart

Generally, beneath the Smith Chart, there are radial scaling parameter axes. Assuming there is a complex impedance point in the chart, connect it with the center point, rotate it along the radius to the principal axis, and project it onto the radial scaling parameter axis, as shown in the figure:

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220613105800.png)

On this axis, we can read out some parameters:

- Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR): 2.3:1
- Return Loss: 8.10dB
- Reflection Coefficient
  - Voltage: 0.155
  - Power: 0.39

Moreover, we can also find that the points appearing on this radius circle have the same parameters.

### Relationship between VSWR and Transmission Line

As mentioned earlier, on the circle drawn with the system impedance (center point) as the center and the distance to the complex impedance point as the radius, the VSWR of points with different impedances on the circle is equal. The length of one complete revolution on the circle is equivalent to half a wavelength. Therefore, **when the length of the transmission line increases by half a wavelength, the complex impedance will rotate one more revolution along the circle**.

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220601172933.png)

From this, it can be concluded that the length of the transmission line from the source end to the antenna should be controlled to be an integer multiple of half a wavelength of the antenna, in order to prevent the observed impedance from deviating from the actual impedance of the antenna. If the length is a general value, the compensation can be done using the transmission line model in the [**SimNEC**](http://www.ae6ty.com/smith_charts.html) simulation software.

There is also an interesting phenomenon. If the length of the transmission line with an open-circuit termination is one-quarter wavelength (half a circle), it appears as if it is short-circuited. Conversely, if the length of the transmission line with a short-circuit termination is one-quarter wavelength, the observed characteristics appear as if it is open-circuited:

## Design of Matching Circuits

Usually, in a circuit, we connect inductors and capacitors in series or parallel to move the complex impedance point and match the impedance.

- **Series Inductor**: Move clockwise along the constant resistance circle.
- **Series Capacitor**: Move counterclockwise along the constant resistance circle.
- **Parallel Inductor**: Move counterclockwise along the constant conductance circle.
- **Parallel Capacitor**: Move clockwise along the constant conductance circle.

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220601162955.png)

Qualitatively, whether in series or parallel, adding inductance will move the complex impedance point upward, while adding capacitance will move it downward.

## Simple L-Type Matching Circuit

Assuming the measured complex impedance value of the current circuit is $Z_L$, and we need to adjust it to the ideal $Z_0$ (ideally at the center point, or on the 50Ω resistance circle), we can use inductors or capacitors to form a simple L-shaped matching circuit to move the complex impedance point on the Smith Chart. The combination of inductors or capacitors depends on the initial position of $Z_L$ on the Smith Chart. Based on the distribution of $Z_L$ shown in the figure below, we can select a suitable combination to construct the L-type matching circuit:

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220613100034.png)

For example, for the initial complex impedance value $Z_L$ shown in the figure below (black dot), we can use the construction of the L-type matching circuit provided in the small figure to adjust it to the ideal $Z_0$ (red dot):

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220613102205.png)

For convenience in debugging, we outline the standard constant conductance circle and constant resistance circle on the chart. The following steps can be performed in the [**SimNEC**](http://www.ae6ty.com/smith_charts.html) simulation software:

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220613103303.png)

1. Add a series inductor and move it clockwise along the constant resistance circle until it intersects with the constant conductance circle.
2. Add a parallel capacitor and move it clockwise along the constant conductance circle until it reaches the center point.

The method can be roughly summarized as follows: **start from the load end**, add the first component to move the complex impedance point to the standard constant conductance or constant resistance circle; add the second component to move it along the standard constant conductance or constant resistance circle to the center point. The values of the selected components can be read in the software.

For the debugging of the actual matching circuit, you can refer to the article [**Design of General Antenna Matching Circuit**](https://wiki-power.com/%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%E5%A4%A9%E7%BA%BF%E5%8C%B9%E9%85%8D%E7%94%B5%E8%B7%AF%E7%9A%84%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1).
