# Ice-breaking Activity - Summary of Experience

## Problems Encountered

1. Unclear formulation of rules, insufficient testing of game process, lack of serious attention, resulting in on-site modification of rules.
2. Material receiving time was too late and lacked dedicated management personnel.
3. Time for arranging staff and assigning tasks was too late.
4. Staff were not clear about the rules/ did not do their job well, lacked team awareness and time sense.
5. Some game rules were too complicated, making the atmosphere low.
6. The responsible photographer was not trained, and not all people were included in the group photo. The quality of activity filming/photography was poor.
7. No overall decision maker was appointed to handle unexpected situations.
8. Props were not prepared before the activity.
9. The rules needed to be repeated for each group participating in the activity.
10. The overall scorekeeper was missing.
11. After the activity, there were many printed papers scattered around the venue, but the garbage bags were nearby.
12. The order of serving dishes during dinner was wrong, making everyone feel that the amount of food was insufficient.

## How to Improve

### Two Weeks in Advance

At least two weeks in advance, convene staff to hold a planning meeting to discuss the following:

- Refer to previous materials to formulate the overall process of the activity, the initial game rules, and scoring rules (as simple and easy to understand as possible).
- Borrow/purchase materials (activity booths can prepare some snacks to prevent hunger).
- Arrange staff responsibilities, determine the overall responsible person for the activity, material management personnel, and overall scorekeeping responsible person, with a clear reward and punishment system.
- Contingency plans for different situations (rainy days, preparation of medicines).

### One Week in Advance

- Test game rules (not just once).
- Check and supplement materials.

### One Day in Advance

- Gift packaging.
- Prepare BGM for the activity (games, awards, etc.).
- Release rules (staff only answer rule questions).
- Set up the photo-taking position, familiarize yourself with the lighting conditions of the activity venue, and prepare batteries for several cameras.
- Props that can be arranged on the venue should be arranged first.

### During the Ice-breaking Activity

- Emphasize the start time, start on time, and do not delay most people's time because of latecomers.
- Staff
  - Must be responsible and ensure that their work is in place, and not leave their post without authorization.
  - After completing their own tasks, they can help other positions.

### After the Ice-breaking Activity

- Organize and clean up the venue.
- Count the materials and move them back to the laboratory.

### Dinner

- Serve dessert/cold dishes first during dinner, and during this time, the old students can introduce themselves.
- Don't just have one bottle of cola for drinks, it's best to have cola + orange juice.
- Serve rice first (to fill up), and alternate between meat and vegetables when serving dishes.
