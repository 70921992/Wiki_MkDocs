# Technical Document Writing Guidelines

As we all know, consistent style and grammar in formatting can make articles more readable and reduce communication costs.

## Article Structure

When writing technical articles, you can refer to the following structure:

```markdown
# Article Title

One or two sentences introducing the content of this article.

## Effect

Please briefly introduce the usage of the demo and show the effect.

## Principle

Please introduce the principle step by step.

## Summary

Make a simple summary.

## Reference and Acknowledgment

- [Reference 1](Link of Reference 1)
- [Reference 2](Link of Reference 2)
```

## Formatting Guidelines

### Paragraph

- When using Markdown syntax, the first line does not need to be indented.
- There should be a blank line between paragraphs.

### Scenarios that Require Spaces

- Between Chinese and English, and numbers:
  > Incorrect: `Qt生成器是一个针对C++的跨平台IDE`  
  > Correct: `Qt 生成器是一个针对 C++ 的跨平台 IDE`
- Between numbers and units: (but no space is needed between numbers and percentage signs)
  > Incorrect: `其频率为 72MHz，占空比为 50 %。`  
  > Correct: `其频率为 72 MHz，占空比为 50%。`
- Between normal and special characters (links, bold, italics, etc.):
  > This **font** uses bold style.  
  > Please **[click here](https://wiki.wildwolf.pw/)** to subscribe.
- After English half-width punctuation:
  > Hello, world.
- Between Chinese and dashes:
  > Markdown - A highly efficient way of writing.

### Text Style

1. When mixing Chinese and English, Chinese full-width punctuation is used by default.
2. When mixing Chinese and English, if there is a whole sentence in English, half-width English punctuation is used in this sentence.
3. Inline links are generally bolded to improve readability.
4. Use accurate proper nouns:
   > Incorrect: 使用 github 登录  
   > Correct: 使用 GitHub 登录
5. Chinese uses straight quotes instead of ordinary quotes:
   > Incorrect: 华广机器人队，也称为“野狼队”  
   > Correct: 华广机器人队，也称为「野狼队」
6. Do not repeat punctuation marks to emphasize.

## Writing Style

- If it is not necessary, do not increase entities.
- In order to improve readability, try to avoid using long sentences and use multiple simple sentences instead.
- Arguments should be supported by evidence, and avoid only stating theories without examples.
