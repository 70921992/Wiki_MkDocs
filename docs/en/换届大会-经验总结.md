# Summary of the Election Conference

## Problems Encountered

1. Unclear responsibilities of staff and inadequate communication
2. Unable to borrow a large classroom, speakers, or stools for the medium-sized classrooms, resulting in some people standing without seats
3. Late release of the KT board and logo board designs
4. Technical issues with classroom equipment during video playback
5. Poor guidance for attendees to find their seats
6. The host was not familiar with the overall flow of the conference and read from a script without improvisation
7. No one took charge when problems arose
8. Issues with the design and printing of appointment letters and their distribution
9. Failure to set up the camera properly for the group photo, resulting in some people being left out

## How to Improve

### Two Weeks in Advance

The election conference is a significant event that requires at least two weeks' notice to gather staff and hold a planning meeting to discuss the following:

- The overall flow of the conference
- Selection of the host, writing of the script, and training for improvisation
- Identification of speakers and advance notification to prepare speeches
- Materials needed for the conference, such as signs, appointment letters, speakers, KT boards, decorations, cameras, etc.
- Identification of attendees and invited guests (teachers, previous team members)
- Clarification of staff responsibilities (documented on paper)
- Approval from the responsible teacher for the use of a classroom (preferably the large classroom on the 4th floor, which needs to be reserved at least two weeks in advance, or it may already be taken)
- Identification of the overall event coordinator responsible for resolving disputes and making decisions in case of emergencies

### One Week in Advance

- Notification to all attendees and invitation to guests
- Check and follow up on the delivery of design and purchase materials
- Design and print appointment letters

The overall event coordinator should have a clear understanding of what factors are slowing down the overall process and should begin to follow up on them one week in advance.

### Half a Day in Advance

- Staff gathering
- Venue setup
- Check materials
- Check classroom equipment
- Set up the camera for the group photo
- Rehearse the conference flow and host performance

Do not wait until the last minute to prepare for the conference. Some issues may only become apparent when you arrive at the classroom, and you need sufficient time to address them.

### During the Conference

- Attendee check-in
- Guidance to seats
- In case of emergencies, the overall event coordinator should make decisions

Even with adequate preparation, unexpected situations may arise during the conference, and it is easy for chaos to ensue. At this time, the overall event coordinator should make emergency decisions and take charge. Although there may be mistakes in decision-making, it is better than everyone suggesting different solutions and ultimately not being able to resolve the situation.

### After the Conference

- Staff gathering
- Count and transport materials
- Write a summary report

Compared to last year's election conference, this year's had many more attendees, a better atmosphere, and a greater sense of ceremony. However, various small issues encountered during the process, especially technical issues, did cause some embarrassment for the entire team. Every event will encounter old and new problems, and only by summarizing and providing more experience and lessons for the next event (and the next team) can we effectively avoid pitfalls and better control risks. This way, each event can be better than the last.
