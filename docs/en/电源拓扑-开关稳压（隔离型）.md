# Power Supply Topology - Switching Regulator (Isolated)

In contrast to non-isolated switching regulators, in isolated switching regulators, energy is transmitted through mutually coupled magnetic components (transformers), and the source and load are only coupled through magnetic fields, so there is electrical isolation between the input and output.

## Isolated DC-DC Topology Structure

For isolated DC-DC converters, the commonly used topologies are generally flyback, forward, and push-pull.

In these isolated converters, energy transfer from input to output is accomplished through the transformer. Energy is transmitted through mutually coupled magnetic components (transformers), and the source and load are only coupled through magnetic fields, forming electrical isolation between the input and output. Like non-isolated converters, the regulation process is achieved by adjusting the output voltage through a PWM controller in the feedback loop.

### Flyback

The flyback converter can convert a higher input voltage into a lower stable output voltage. When switch $S_1$ is closed, energy is stored in the magnetic core of the transformer $T_1$, and when switch $S_1$ is opened, the energy is transferred to the secondary side. The topology is as follows:

Note: The switch $S_1$ is actually an electronic switch (such as a power MOS tube), but for ease of understanding, it is simplified as a regular switch here.

Basic principle:

1. Switch $S_1$ is closed (blue solid line)
   - At this time, a loop is formed on the primary side of transformer $T_1$, and the current $I_{S1}$ flowing through the primary winding inductor $L_P$ increases at a rate of $\frac{V_{in}}{L_P}$. There is no current flowing through the secondary winding inductor $L_S$ to the load at this time, and the load current is provided by capacitor $C_1$.
   - The input energy of the transformer at this time is: $\frac{V_{in}*t_{on}}{N}$ (N is the turns ratio)
2. Switch $S_1$ is opened (green dashed line)
   - At this time, due to the collapse of the magnetic field in transformer $T_1$, the voltage in the primary and secondary windings is reversed, and the energy stored in the primary winding is transferred to the secondary winding. During the transfer process, the voltage in the secondary winding rises rapidly, accompanied by a pulse current that decreases at a rate of $\frac{V_{out}}{L_S}$ and supplies power to the load and charges capacitor $C_1$. Diode $D_1$ acts as a peak rectifier here.
   - The output energy of the transformer at this time is: $V_{out}*t_{off}$

Because the energy transfer of the transformer is conserved, $\frac{V_{in}*t_{on}}{N}=V_{out}*t_{off}$, so:

$$
V_{out}=\frac{1}{N}\cdot\frac{Î´}{1-Î´} \cdot V_{in}
$$

It can be seen that the flyback and buck-boost transfer formulas differ only by a factor of 1/N. The advantage of flyback is that the output voltage can be adjusted very high when the duty cycle is very small, so it is suitable for power supplies that output high voltage. Secondly, multiple secondary windings can be added to achieve multiple outputs, and the polarities can be different, suitable for low-cost designs.

The disadvantage of flyback is that the transformer gap magnetic core should be carefully selected and should not be allowed to enter the saturation state, because if the hysteresis phenomenon is severe, the efficiency of the transformer will be greatly reduced. In addition, the high peak current and eddy current losses in the winding are also problems. These two problems limit the practical operating frequency range of flyback. Finally, when S1 is opened, there will be a large inductive spike on the primary winding, which will put a lot of pressure on the switch field-effect transistor.

### Forward

The forward converter can generate a stable output voltage based on the function of turns ratio. The topology is as follows:

Basic principle:

1. Switch $S_1$ is closed (blue solid line)
   - At this time, the primary winding of transformer $T_1$ forms a loop, and the current $I_{S1}$ flowing through the primary winding inductance $L_P$ increases at a rate of $\frac{V_{in}}{L_P}$. Since the primary and secondary windings are mutually coupled, the increase in current in the primary winding will cause an induced current to be generated on the secondary winding, and the induced voltage at the two ends of the secondary winding is $\frac{V_{in}}{N}$. The current on the secondary winding increases at a rate of $\frac{V_{in}}{L_1 N}$, and finally supplies power to the load $R_L$ and the output capacitor $C_1$ through the rectifying diode $D_1$ and the output inductor $L_1$.
   - At this time, the input energy of the transformer is: $(\frac{V_{in}}{N}-V_{out})\cdot t_{on}$ (N is the turns ratio)
2. Switch $S_1$ is opened (green dashed line)
   - When the voltage across capacitor $C_1$ gradually rises to the upper threshold, a "turn-off" feedback signal (generally implemented by an optocoupler) is generated, causing switch $S_1$ to open and interrupting the source current supply. At this time, the reset winding and diode $D_3$ jointly maintain the magnetic field in the transformer without disappearing (but it will also cause the current to decrease at a rate of $\frac{V_{in}}{L_P}$). The voltage at the two ends of the secondary winding will reverse polarity, and the reverse current will decrease at a rate of $\frac{V_{out}}{L_1}$. After passing through the freewheeling diode $D_2$ and inductor $L_1$, it supplies power to the load $R_L$ and the output capacitor $C_1$. When the voltage across $C_1$ drops to the threshold, a "turn-on" feedback signal is generated to close $S_1$ again and start a new cycle.
   - At this time, the output energy of the transformer is: $V_{out}\cdot t_{off}$

According to the energy transfer conservation of the transformer (i.e., energy conservation), $(\frac{V_{in}}{N}-V_{out})*t_{on}=V_{out}\cdot t_{off}$, and we can get:

$$
V_{out}=\frac{Î´}{N} \cdot V_{in}
$$

Compared with Flyback, the difference of Forward is that it continuously transfers energy from the primary to the secondary through the transformer, without storing energy in the air gap magnetic core of the transformer. In this way, the magnetic core no longer needs an air gap, and correspondingly, it will not cause losses and EMI radiation. Because hysteresis loss is no longer a serious problem in Forward, the inductance of the magnetic core can be very large, and the peak current can be reduced as a result, which further reduces the losses in the winding and diode, and reduces the ripple current of the input and output.

Therefore, under the same output power, Forward is more efficient than Flyback, but the disadvantage is that the cost is relatively high, and a minimum load needs to be set to prevent entering the discontinuous mode, because the energy transfer mode is completely different in the discontinuous mode.
