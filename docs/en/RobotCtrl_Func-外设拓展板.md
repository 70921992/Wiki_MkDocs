### Power Supply

The RobotCtrl_Func board has 2 built-in LDOs, similar to those in the RobotCtrl_Core board. One LDO is used for external sensor peripherals, while the other is used solely for the Ethernet circuit.

The Ethernet communication circuit is based on an Ethernet PHY chip and uses the RMII interface to communicate with the microcontroller. Communication is achieved through an RJ45 port with a built-in isolation transformer that connects to an external network cable. The Ethernet circuit's clock uses an external 25M passive crystal oscillator and requires independent power to reduce power interference. The same low-dropout linear regulator power supply scheme as the core board is used to power the Ethernet circuit separately. The principle of Ethernet communication can be found in the article "HAL Library Development Notes - Ethernet Communication (LwIP)."

The CAN communication circuit is built on a CAN transceiver chip and uses CAN differential voltage transmission. The CAN protocol controller (such as a microcontroller) is connected to the transceiver through a serial line (RX/TX), which is then converted into a CAN signal (CANH/CANL) on the transceiver and selects high-speed/silent mode through the RS pin. A 120Î© terminal resistor must be added to the CAN bus to match the impedance and reduce signal reflection. The principle of CAN communication can be found in the articles "Communication Protocol - CAN" and "HAL Library Development Notes - Serial Communication."

The serial communication circuit is based on a UART chip and uses a serial port to communicate with external devices. The UART chip converts parallel data into serial data for transmission and converts serial data into parallel data for reception. The principle of serial communication can be found in the article "HAL Library Development Notes - Serial Communication."

The RobotCtrl_Func board is equipped with a serial communication circuit with RS-232 level and additionally has a USART1/UART5 with TTL level. The principle of serial communication can be referred to in the articles "Communication Protocol - Serial Communication" and "HAL Library Development Notes - Serial Communication".

The RS-232 communication circuit uses a chip that converts TTL to 232 level to convert the TTL of the microcontroller to RS-232 level. To improve EMC performance, the DB9 socket shell connection pin can be connected to a TVS diode to ground, and the TTL to 232 chip requires an external power decoupling and bootstrap capacitor.

The buzzer circuit uses a 12V buzzer and can be controlled by a transistor.

The principle of user buttons and LEDs can be referred to in RobotCtrl_Core, and will not be further explained here.

The MPU6050 module is directly mounted and reserved for I2C interface for communication with the microcontroller. The principle of I2C communication can be referred to in the articles "Communication Protocol - I2C" and "HAL Library Development Notes - I2C Communication (MPU6050)".

The interface for the infrared ranging sensor is also available.

Interface Circuit for Four Infrared Ranging Sensors

The interface circuit for the four infrared ranging sensors uses 12V power and signal (NPN normally open type). Therefore, 12V is supplied from RobotCtrl_Power and four optocoupler isolation chips are added to transmit high and low level signals. The design of the optocoupler isolation circuit requires calculating the resistance value of the current limiting resistor based on the current size to ensure that it is within the triggering voltage range specified in the data sheet. The principle of optocouplers can be found in the article "Basic Components - Optocouplers".

Power Input Interface and B2B Connector

The power input interface of the peripheral expansion board has 4 rows of pins for connection with the power supply board at the bottom. The B2B connector is used for power supply and data communication for the main control board.
