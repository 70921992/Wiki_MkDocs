# Power Topology - Linear Regulator

The function of a linear regulator is to convert a stable or unstable input voltage source into a stable output voltage. During normal operation, even if there are significant fluctuations in the input voltage, the output voltage can remain stable.

## Principle of Linear Regulator

Most linear regulators are closed-loop controlled. To obtain the desired output voltage value, we can adjust the ratio of R1/R2 so that the voltage at the amplifier's inverting input is equal to the reference voltage $V_{ref}$ at the amplifier's non-inverting input. The function of the error amplifier feedback loop is to keep the voltage difference between the two input terminals at 0.

The principle is that if the load decreases/increasing input voltage, the output voltage will increase. The voltage at the amplifier's inverting input will be higher than the reference voltage $V_{ref}$ at the amplifier's non-inverting input, and the voltage at the output of the error amplifier will be negative. This will cause the voltage at the base of the transistor to decrease, and ultimately the output voltage of the transistor will also decrease. Conversely, if the load increases/decreasing input voltage, the voltage at the amplifier's inverting input will decrease, which is less than the reference voltage $V_{ref}$ at the amplifier's non-inverting input. This will cause the voltage at the base of the transistor to increase, resulting in an increase in output voltage to compensate for the originally decreasing output voltage. The feedback loop can simultaneously adjust the voltage changes caused by input voltage changes (line regulation) and load changes (load regulation).

## Efficiency of Linear Regulator

The efficiency of a linear regulator refers to the ratio of the output power $P_{out}$ to the input power $P_{in}$:

$$
Î· = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}
$$

where,

$$
P_{out}=V_{out}*I_{out},
$$

$$
P_{in}=V_{in}*I_{in},
$$

$$
I_{in}=I_{out}+I_{q}
$$

$I_{q}$ is the static current under no load.

## Low Dropout Linear Regulator - LDO

In a conventional linear regulator, a bipolar transistor is used as a current amplifier. Due to the formation of a Darlington circuit, there is a certain voltage drop.

If a P-channel field-effect transistor is used instead of a bipolar transistor, a so-called low dropout linear regulator (LDO) is obtained, which has a necessary voltage drop of only a few hundred millivolts.

Because the necessary voltage drop of the field-effect transistor depends only on its forward conduction voltage (equivalent to $R_{ds}*I_{load}$). Usually, the resistance $R_{ds}$ is very small, so the necessary voltage drop is also very low.

## Advantages, Disadvantages, and Applications

### Advantages

- Simple and inexpensive circuit
- Low output noise
- High isolation from noise
- Fast transient response

### Disadvantages

- A certain voltage drop is required to achieve voltage stabilization, so it can only be used for voltage reduction.
- In the case of a large voltage drop, the conversion efficiency is relatively low, and the losses are consumed in the form of heat, affecting the stability and reliability of the board.
- Emphasis on power, even if the load circuit does not require a large current. The consequence of this is that all components work at full load even when not necessary, resulting in much higher heat generation.
- In the case of insufficient voltage drop, there will be significant ripple.

### Applications

- Analog circuits, clock generation circuits, etc. that require strict power supply noise requirements.
- Digital circuit power supply scenarios with low current and little impact on power conversion efficiency.
