# THE Hack 2019 Hackathon

## Introduction

THE Hack 2019 Hackathon was held at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My team and I participated in the competition and after 36 hours of hard work, we achieved 8th place overall and won the Ruff Award.

## Project Journey

This year's competition had different topics to choose from. Initially, we chose the direction of smart homes and planned to create a smart home kit for dormitories. However, we eventually decided to focus on the topic of **how to enable vulnerable groups to enjoy the benefits of technology**. Our team consisted of a product manager and a designer, and we approached the topic from a psychological and user needs perspective, analyzing what the judges and sponsors would value.

Our project this year was called AIO - Care, a smart elderly care platform based on active learning models. I was responsible for the simple implementation of the hardware part, using sensors to collect data for the server to analyze and provide a more comfortable home care experience for the elderly.

The product concept and direction were led by our product managers, Amihua Lau and Ada, who did a great job. In addition, Amihua Lau was responsible for the machine learning algorithm and PPT production, while Ada, as the Human Resource, provided us with a lot of help and advice (which directly determined the direction of our product) and provided us with countless snacks and drinks, providing us with strong logistical support. They were the undisputed leaders of our team. In addition, we would like to thank our neighbor, Yi Lin Weng, who created a 3D model for our product.

I was responsible for the simple implementation of the hardware part of the product, and the code has been open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/linyuxuanlin/Project-of-THE-Hack), based on Arduino. It was a simple demo, so I won't go into detail.

Compared to the competition two years ago, where we only focused on technology, this time we developed a complete business model and profit model. We learned the tricks of this type of competition and gained a lot of experience from excellent team projects. This is just the beginning, and we believe that we can achieve better results in next year's Hackathon.

In this type of competition, the direction of human care is always popular. From the sponsor's perspective, it is always more important than the level of technology. In the 36-hour competition, we could only create a simple demo with technical development. However, it is the rendering and packaging of the product that can make it stand out. By presenting the creativity and concept of the product to the sponsors, this is the trick to winning awards in this type of competition.
