# Daily Life of a Product Manager

## Daily Schedule

**The most important thing is to determine what needs to be done today.** For a product manager, the most important thing is to determine what the team members and themselves need to do today. They not only need to consider their own schedule, but also allocate considerable attention and time to the work of team members. After all, **the work results of a product manager depend on others to achieve**.

> Therefore, the first thing I do when I arrive at the company in the morning is to organize my schedule for the day on Todoist, and assign tasks that need to be completed by others to the team's collaborative tools; I try to complete the organization before other colleagues arrive. If a colleague arrives during the process, I will stop my work and **confirm what they need to do today first, and continue to communicate with all colleagues I need to confirm the schedule with until finished**.

**Product managers must be familiar with the work status and plans of other team members**. Otherwise, some understanding is difficult to establish:

- What stages did the product go through from design to final product?
- Which functions can be combined to make design and development easier?
- How much time did different functions consume during development?
- Why does frequent changes in requirements cause great difficulties for colleagues?

## MVP Principle

The MVP principle, which stands for Minimum Viable Product, was first proposed by Eric Ries, the author of "The Lean Startup". It means that when you want to build a product, you should first implement it in the simplest way possible, and then continue to improve it as long as users are willing to buy it.
