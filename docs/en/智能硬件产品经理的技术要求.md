# Technical Requirements for Smart Hardware Product Managers

## Hardware Knowledge

- **Hardware Design**: Basic hardware design knowledge (implementing hardware functions with software, cost reduction is always the main theme of hardware design)
- **ID/MD Design**: Appearance greatly affects sales, and the appearance also needs to be able to be processed
- **Production and Manufacturing**: The designed product must be able to be produced, and there should be a rough understanding of the production process

## Software Knowledge

- **Embedded Software**: Firmware functions should be efficient, not too complicated; online firmware upgrades for APPs should be added as soon as possible, and forced upgrades should be available
- **App**: The APP should be simple and not too complicated. Pay attention to making it easy and guiding users to upgrade, including updating the APP/firmware, in order to achieve rapid iteration
- **Business Backend**: Also known as cloud services. It has various modules and interfaces, and can support various functions and data docking between the front-end App and Rom. For small projects, it is recommended to use third-party services and not to dig holes
- **Management Backend**: Including CMS/BOSS systems, data platforms, etc. It includes user management systems, device management systems, operation platforms, data statistics and reports, BI analysis systems, big data, etc.
- **Production Management Software**: Add unique ID/MAC addresses to the product, and prepare how to cooperate with the production management system, how to operate PMC, and whether data needs to be synchronized to the management backend before production.

## Third-Party Integration

- **HomeKit/Mi Home/WeChat Hardware and other platforms**: Read and understand the integration documents of mainstream hardware platforms
- **Third-Party Account System**: Such as WeChat/QQ login, etc.
- **Third-Party Sharing**: Such as WeChat Moments/Weibo/Twitter/Facebook, etc., which are essential for smart hardware
- **Third-Party Cloud Services**: Such as AWS/Ayla/Aliyun/JiGuanCloud, etc.
