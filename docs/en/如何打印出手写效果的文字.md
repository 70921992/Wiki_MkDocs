# How to Print Handwritten Text Effectively

Reference video: <https://www.bilibili.com/video/av87409493/?spm_id_from=333.788.videocard.0>

The main steps are as follows:

**Use a Handwriting Font**: Use a digital tablet to create your own font or use someone else's handwriting font directly.  
**Use Word Macro Code**: Randomly adjust font size and line spacing.  
**Manual Processing**: Create correction marks, make the paper look old, and use an inkjet printer to let the ink penetrate the back of the paper.

This method is suitable for copying a large amount of repetitive content (such as copying text) or for open-book exams that only allow handwritten materials.
