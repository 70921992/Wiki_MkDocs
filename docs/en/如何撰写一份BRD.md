# How to Write a BRD

- A Guide to Writing a Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## What is a BRD?

In short, a BRD systematizes and organizes ideas. On the one hand, it helps to clarify project direction, and on the other hand, it is used to present to people with resources in order to obtain the resources needed for product development.

In the product development process, project approval is a watershed moment. Prior to approval, a large amount of research and investigation is often conducted, and a plan is developed based on the research results. This plan is the BRD.

## How to Write a BRD

### 1. Product Introduction

The product introduction should briefly explain what kind of product you are making. The explanation should be concise and preferably one sentence that can clearly explain the product's purpose, positioning, vision, etc. It can be analyzed and described from the perspectives of both **users** and **professionals**.

### 2. Product Value

The product value should explain to decision-makers why this product should be made. It can be described from two perspectives: **user needs** (what needs are met, what pain points are solved, etc.) and **strategy** (what value it can bring to the enterprise, how it can generate market profits, expand market share, etc.).

### 3. Product Solution

The product solution should give decision-makers an idea of the product's framework and outline, mainly including the following aspects:

1. **Product Form**: What is the architecture of this product? Is it an information-based product, a social-based product, a search-based product, or an O2O product?
2. **Business Model**: Is this a 2C or 2B business? Who are the participants, and how is the closed loop formed?
3. **Operation Model**: What kind of operational strategy and means are used to operate the product, such as teacher resources in educational products, recruitment or crowdsourcing, etc.?
4. **Profit Model**: How will the product make money, such as through advertising, value-added services, or selling goods?

### 4. Market Analysis

Product development cannot be done in isolation, and the market situation must be considered, including:

- **Market Capacity**: This needs to be evaluated based on an analysis of demand and an assessment of the population. Decision-makers will use this to determine whether it is worth investing in.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Look at other products on the market, how they solve problems, what user needs they meet, what needs they do not meet, how much investment they require, what kind of team they have, what kind of output they have, and what our advantages and disadvantages are in comparison.
- **Judgment on the Future of the Market**: This includes the future market competition pattern, industry risks, policy changes, industry development direction, etc.
- **Market Opportunities**: How to find a breakthrough, and what kind of status can this opportunity help us achieve?

### 5. Execution Plan

Describe in general terms how to make this product:

- **Phase One**: Verify user needs with MVP, from xxx to xxx
- **Phase Two**: Improve the product and expand the user base, from xxx to xxx
- **Phase Three, Phase Four, etc.**

### 6. Financial Forecast

Estimate the investment cost and output revenue. Decision-makers attach great importance to this part. Investment is relatively easy to calculate, and income can be estimated based on reference values for the profit model (such as CPC/CPA for advertising).

### 7. Risk Forecast

Risk refers to behaviors and factors that may affect the achievement of product goals or increase product costs. When considering risks, we not only need to evaluate all possible risks, determine the likelihood and severity of risks, but also provide corresponding avoidance plans and clarify the avoidance benefits of the plans.

## Notes

- A BRD is not just a simple document, and there is a lot of preparation work behind it.
- Focus less on product details in the document and more on the part that describes the product's business value.
- Pay attention to logical rigor and try to be concise and clear.
- Based on reality, try to guide the content to be biased towards your own interests.
