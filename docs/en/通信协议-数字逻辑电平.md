# Communication Protocol - Digital Logic Levels

## TTL Level Interface

TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) is based on a transistor structure, with a standard power supply of 5V. Due to the large gap between 2.4V and 5V, voltage fluctuations will increase system power consumption, so LVTTL (Low Voltage Transistor-Transistor Logic) levels were compressed, with 3.3V and 2.5V LVTTL options.

Characteristics of (LV) TTL levels:

- TTL circuits use current control devices, with fast circuit speed and short transmission delay time (5-10ns), but high power consumption.
- TTL levels generally have serious overshoot, and may require a 22Ω/33Ω resistor at the starting end.
- When the TTL level input pin is floating, it is internally recognized as a high level. If a pull-down is needed, a resistor below 1k should be connected.
- The TTL level interface speed is generally limited to within 30MHz. Because the input end of the BJT has an input capacitance of several pF (forming an LPF), if the input signal exceeds a certain frequency, the signal will be lost.
- Its driving capability is generally up to several tens of milliamps. The normal working signal voltage is generally high. If it is close to an ECL circuit with a lower signal voltage, significant crosstalk problems may occur.

## CMOS Level Interface

CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) is based on an NMOS and PMOS structure, with a standard power supply of 5V. Like TTL, CMOS also has LVCMOS level standards, and because the MOS tube has a lower conduction gate voltage than the BJT, LVCMOS can use lower voltage communication. LVCMOS has 3.3V, 2.5V, 1.8V, 1.5V, and 1.2V standards.

Characteristics of (LV) CMOS levels:

- CMOS circuits use voltage control devices, with slow circuit speed and long transmission delay time (25-50ns), but low power consumption. However, at high conversion frequencies, the CMOS series actually consumes more power than TTL.
- CMOS interfaces have a larger noise margin than TTL interfaces, with input impedance much greater than TTL input impedance. Under normal circumstances, CMOS power consumption and anti-interference ability are far superior to TTL.
- The CMOS structure has parasitic controllable silicon structures inside. When the input or input pin is higher than a certain value above VCC (such as 0.7V for some chips), if the current is large enough, it may cause latch-up and burn out the chip.
- The input impedance of CMOS circuits is very high, so the coupling capacitance can be very small and large electrolytic capacitors are not needed. Since CMOS circuits usually have weak driving capability, they must be converted to TTL before driving ECL circuits. In addition, when designing CMOS interface circuits, care should be taken to avoid excessive capacitive loads, which will slow down the rise time and increase the power consumption of the driving device (because capacitive loads do not consume power).

## Comparison of Each Level Standard

Digital circuits have a dual threshold standard. Although only two states, 0 and 1, are ultimately represented, the voltage below which is 0 and the voltage above which is 1 are agreed upon through the dual threshold standard.

## Serial and Parallel Communication

Data bits can be transmitted in parallel or serial form. In parallel communication, the data bits are sent simultaneously, each through a separate line. The following figure shows the parallel transmission of the letter `C` in binary (01000011):

In serial communication, the bits are sent one at a time through a single line. The following figure shows the serial transmission of the letter `C`:
