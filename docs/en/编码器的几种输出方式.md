# Several Output Modes of Encoder

## Open Collector Output (OC)

Open Collector Output means opening the collector of the transistor. The Open Collector Output is an output circuit with the emitter of the output circuit's transistor as the common terminal and the collector floating. It is generally divided into NPN and PNP Open Collector Outputs.

PNP Open Collector:

When using it, the signal pin needs to be pulled up to achieve the function of Open Collector Output.

## Voltage Output

Voltage Output is based on the circuit of the collector open circuit output, with a pull-up resistor connected between the power supply and the collector, so that there can be a stable voltage state between the collector and the power supply. There is no need for a pull-up resistor when using it.

## Complementary Output

Complementary Output is an output circuit with NPN and PNP two output transistors. According to the high/low output signal, the two output transistors interact to perform on/off actions. Compared with the circuit with collector open circuit output, the transmission distance of the circuit with complementary output can be slightly longer, and it can also be connected to the collector open circuit input machine (NPN, PNP).

## Linear Drive Output

Linear Drive Output is an output mode that uses the RS-422 standard and the AM26LS31 chip for high-speed and long-distance data transmission. The signal is output in differential form, so it has stronger anti-interference ability. The output signal needs to be received by a device that can specifically receive Linear Drive Output.
