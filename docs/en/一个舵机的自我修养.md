# Self-cultivation of a Servo

How to modify a servo to make it a 360째 continuous rotation servo, and how to use code to solve noise issues?

## Background

Generally speaking, servos can only rotate 180째 (there are also continuous rotation servos available online, but they are more expensive). If you want to use a servo as the driving force for a small car, you can modify it to a continuous rotation servo.

## Modifying to a 360째 Servo

### 1. Preparation

Tools:

- Screwdriver
- Hot glue gun
- Diagonal pliers

### 2. Disassemble the Servo

**Remember the position of each gear.**

### 3. Modify the Gear

Pick out the largest gear and use diagonal pliers to cut off the raised part at the back. ![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/2218072-2fab2f9620b5efb2.jpg)

Find a screwdriver that is slightly larger than the diameter of the shaft, and enlarge the inner diameter of this gear so that it can rotate freely on the shaft. ![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/2218072-b5de55e257df450e.jpg)

### 4. Seal the Potentiometer

Before doing this step, we must first **return the servo to the center position**.

Find an Arduino board and burn a program into it to make the servo return to the center position:

```cpp
//by Lin
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo;
void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);//servo connected to D9 of Arduino
}

void loop() {
  myservo.write(90); //make the servo return to the center position
}
```

As shown in the figure, connect the servo, and you will find that it keeps rotating.

Turn the right shaft back and forth a few times to find a position where the motor stops (adjust the potentiometer to the middle value here). ![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/2218072-964d07b3c4c304d4.jpg)

Glue the potentiometer and seal it. Be careful not to accidentally rotate the shaft at this time. If you do, you will have to go back to step three.

### 5. Assembly

Assemble the gear back, being careful not to mistake the gear positions. Tighten the screws, and you will have a 360째 continuous rotation servo.

### 6. Debugging

Burn the following code:

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo;
int pos = 0;
void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);
  }
void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) {
    // in steps of 1 degree
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);
  }
  for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) {
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);
  }
}
```

Servo status: servo acceleration-deceleration-reverse acceleration-deceleration. ....

## Eliminating Noise

### Background

> When using a servo to make related IoT devices, it is often encountered that **the servo has reached the specified position, but there is still noise**. Annoyed by this, @Zhang Shibao came up with a method, which is to connect a relay in series on the servo power supply line, and when it is not necessary to rotate, the Arduino controls the relay to power off. But this method will increase hardware costs and increase code complexity.

### Solution

When the servo needs to work, use the `attach()` function, and use the `detach()` function after the servo has finished working.

```cpp
{
    servo.attach(9);
    servo.write(pos);
    delay(250);

    // Disconnect the servo to prevent sound
    servo.detach();
}
```

## FAQ
