# Reading "Hackers and Painters"

## "Hacker Spirit"

> Hacker behavior must include three characteristics: **fun, high intelligence, and exploratory spirit**. Only when their behavior meets all three criteria can they be called "hackers".

> For hackers, a closed door is a challenge, and a locked door is an insult. ... Hackers believe that **as long as it helps improve the status quo and explore the unknown, people should be allowed to freely use various tools and information**. When a hacker needs something to help create, explore, or correct a device, he will not seek trouble and will not accept the absurd concept of property rights.

## "Work"

> Humans like to work, and in most places in the world, your job is your identity. But everything we did then was meaningless, at least it seemed so at the time. At best, those things were just practice for the actual work we might do in the distant future. The goals it aimed at were so far away that we didn't even know what we were practicing for. More commonly, those things were just a series of randomly set ropes, and you were asked to jump over them one by one. **The words you encounter in learning are designed for exams, not to clarify issues.** (The three main causes of the Civil War are... when it comes to the exam, there will be a question: list the three main causes of the Civil War.) And **there is no way to avoid those things.** Adults have reached a consensus that the way to college is like this. **The only way to escape this empty life is to surrender to it.**

> At the same time, what changes has society undergone? We are forced to face a more serious problem. It has a common cause with many other current problems, which is **"specialization"**. As the degree of specialization of work increases, we must accept longer training. Before the industrial age, children had to work at around 14 years old at the latest. If it was on a farm (most people lived in rural areas at that time), they would start working even earlier. Nowadays, as long as a teenager goes to college, he has to wait until he is 21 or 22 to start working full-time. If you pursue a higher degree, such as a medical doctor or a Ph.D. in philosophy, it may take until you are 30 to complete your studies.

> How can hackers do what they like? I think the solution to this problem is a method that almost all creators know: find a "day job" to support yourself. This term comes from musicians, who perform music at night, so they can find other jobs during the day. More generally, the meaning of "day job" is that you have a job to make money and a job for hobbies.

Specialization is a necessity of modern society, but excessive specialization may deprive individuals of the ability to explore the world. In the era of rapid technological development, the deeper you delve into a certain knowledge, the less likely it is to migrate when new technology stacks appear. I think we should maintain "moderate specialization" and leave time and energy to learn some knowledge that we like. This not only meets the social demand for professional skills, but also maintains the potential for continuous development, which is a better balance for individuals.

## "Creation Methodology"

> The way to create beautiful things is often not to start from scratch, but to make small adjustments based on existing results, or to combine existing ideas in a relatively new way.

> The time when you think through the entire program should be while writing the code, not before.

> I like to sit directly in front of the computer and program, rather than on paper. Worse still, I don't patiently write out the entire program step by step to make sure it's generally correct, but rather pile up the code without regard to right or wrong, and then slowly modify it.

Programming is not writing on paper, and it should be easily modifiable. If the finished product of a project is a building, it is definitely not decorated every time a floor is built. When developing a project, inspiration for details can be recorded first, but "premature optimization" should be avoided, just like when you just built to the third floor, you hurriedly installed glass on the windows of the second floor, and later found that the main structure of the building did not meet the requirements.

> I think this is also the correct mode of multiple people developing software. Cooperation is needed, but don't "cooperate" too much. If a code block is developed by three or four people, no one really "owns" this code block. In the end, it will become like a public utility room, no one manages it, it is dirty and messy, and it is full of redundant code. The correct way to cooperate is to divide the project into strictly defined modules, each of which is clearly responsible for one person. The interfaces between modules are carefully designed, and if possible, the documentation should be written as clearly as a programming language specification.

For team projects, tasks should be divided **according to modules**, so that each person has the right to manage their own part.

> Programs are written for people to read, with the ability to run on machines attached.

> Only in those immature and error-prone areas should you add comments to remind readers to pay attention, just like warning signs only appear at sharp turns on highways.



Here we can think of "The Zen of Python":

> Simple is better than complex.

And we also need to mention the principle of "Occam's Razor":

> Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.

The author explains in the article:

> When you are forced to make things simple, you are forced to face the real problems directly. When you can't get away with surface decoration, you have to do the real essence part.

Regarding how to build good design, the article puts forward these points: simplicity, aesthetics that conform to the essence of history, and imitation of nature.

> Good design is simple design. You can hear this statement from the field of mathematics to the field of painting. In mathematics, it means that shorter proofs are often better proofs. Especially for mathematical axioms, less is more. In programming, this statement also applies. For architects and designers, it means that beauty depends on some carefully selected structural elements, not on the accumulation of surface decorations. (Decorations themselves are not bad, only when they are used to cover up the pale structure, they become a bad thing.) Painting is similar, carefully observed and very representative still life works are often more valuable than "masterpieces" that are extremely gorgeous on the surface but are essentially meaningless repetitions (such as painting works that reproduce very complex lace). In writing, this statement means only saying what must be said and saying it briefly.

> Strangely enough, if you want your work to be attractive to future generations, one way is to make your work attractive to several generations. We can hardly imagine what the future will be like, but it is certain that future generations will not care about today's trends, which is the same as several generations ago. Therefore, if your work is attractive to people today and 1500 years ago, it is very likely to attract people 2500 years from now.

> Good design imitates the design of nature. I'm not saying that the act of imitating nature itself is so good, but that nature has solved many design problems in long-term evolution. Therefore, if your design is close to nature, it will not be bad.

The last point can explain well why "why humans will not evolve wheels".

> At any moment in history, there are some hot projects, and some groups have made great achievements in these projects. If you stay away from these centers, it is almost impossible to achieve great results on your own. To some extent, you can only have a certain impact on trends personally, but you cannot decide trends. In fact, trends decide you.

The individual's influence on history is mostly negligible. If there is no specific trend in the era, you can only go against the current. Understanding the development trend of the era is a necessary condition for creating greater achievements.

> One primitive expression of Parkinson's Law is "work is always completed at the last minute", which later extended to the computer field and became "data will always fill all space", and the more general summary is "demand for a resource will always consume all the supply of this resource."

> People who produce excellent results often feel that they are not doing well enough in the process. Others see their results as great, but the creators themselves see only the flaws in their work. This difference in perspective is not accidental, because only dissatisfaction with the status quo can create outstanding results.

## "Free Thinking"

> Samuel Johnson once said that it takes 100 years for people to reach a consensus on an author's evaluation. You have to wait for his influential friends to die, and then wait for his followers to die, before you can have a fair evaluation of him.

> But what is really frightening is that what is popular at the moment not only includes clothes, but also moral concepts. Obviously arbitrary and baseless wrong views, but most people believe it without knowing it. This is very dangerous. Popular clothes are actually ugly clothes; popular moral concepts are not good but evil. However, if everyone wears popular clothes and you don't, you will be ridiculed; if everyone follows popular moral concepts and you don't, the result will be much more serious, you will be fired, exiled, imprisoned, or even killed.

> If you could sit on a time machine and go back to any era, one thing would not change, and that is "disaster comes from the mouth." You must be careful about what you say. Harmless remarks can get you into big trouble. Today, it is commonplace to say that the earth revolves around the sun. If you say this in 17th century Europe, you will be in big trouble. Galileo said such words and was tried by a religious court.

Sometimes, others may tell you, "You need to adjust your thinking and be well-adjusted according to social needs." The implication seems to be that if you don't agree with society, then it's definitely your own problem. Do you agree with this statement? In fact, it is not only incorrect, but it can also lead to a regression in history. If you truly believe in it, you will not dare to think about anything that does not conform to society, and you will immediately give up your own views, which will lead to real problems.

Once you discover "unspeakable words," what should you do next? My advice is to not say anything, or at least choose the appropriate occasion to speak and only fight the battles that are worth fighting. Debating with fools will only make you a fool. At this point, you need to understand that free thinking is more important than speaking freely. If you feel that you must argue with those people and never swallow your words, you must make your point clear. The result is likely that you will no longer be able to think freely and rationally. I think this kind of arrogance is not acceptable. A better approach is to draw a clear line between your thoughts and speech. Think whatever you want in your mind, but you don't necessarily have to say it out loud. I encourage myself to silently contemplate the most outrageous thoughts in my mind. Your thoughts are an underground organization, and you should never tell outsiders everything that happens there.

In 1638, the English poet John Milton was preparing for his first visit to Italy. Sir Hemy Wootton, who had served as the British ambassador to Venice, told Milton to remember the motto "i pensieri stretti & il viso sciolto." Literally translated, it means "tight-lipped and loose-faced," which means that you should smile at everyone but not speak your true thoughts. Of all the countermeasures, humor is probably the best. Fanatics have one thing in common: a lack of humor. They cannot treat jokes calmly. In the kingdom of humor, they are unhappy, like a knight in heavy armor walking into an ice rink, not knowing what to do. A real-life example is the Victorian-era British, who were known for their court etiquette and conservatism. People laughed at them, and it seemed to have defeated them. Its modern incarnation, "political correctness," will suffer the same fate. "I am glad I wrote 'The Crucible,'" Arthur Miller wrote, "but looking back, I often wish I had that kind of temperament to write a farce reflecting the situation."

If you are part of the tide, how can you see the direction of the current? You can only remain skeptical. Ask yourself, what are the things I cannot say? Why?

A sense of humor is a sign of strength. Having a sense of humor means that you can laugh at misfortune, while losing your sense of humor means that misfortune has deeply hurt you. Therefore, a sign (or at least a characteristic) of strength is to face your life with ease.

## "Market"

The real battlefield for competing in software design is the emerging market, where no one has built defenses yet. As long as you can make bold designs and have one person or a group of people responsible for designing and implementing the product, you can defeat large companies here. Microsoft started out this way, as did Apple and HP. I think almost all successful startups have done this.

No piracy is an "advantage," but it is also a problem. A certain amount of piracy is beneficial to software companies. No matter how much your software is priced, some users will never buy it. If these users use pirated software, you do not suffer any loss. In fact, you earn more because your software now has one more user, and your market influence is greater. This user may graduate and then pay for your software.

McDonald's is a fast-food chain that relies on a fast-food service system that can be replicated in every corner of the world. Every McDonald's franchise must strictly follow operating procedures, making it operate like software. Therefore, McDonald's also conforms to the "one-time development, universal application" model.

This is not only a good way for startups to operate, but it is also the essence of startups. Venture capitalists (VCs) know this and have given it a name - barriers to entry. If you have a new idea and go to a VC to ask for investment, he will first ask you a few questions, one of which is whether it is difficult for others to copy your model. In other words, how high are the barriers to entry that you have set for your competitors? You had better make a convincing explanation of why your technology is difficult to replicate. Otherwise, once large companies see it, they will make their own versions, plus their brand, capital, and distribution capabilities, and overnight they will take away your entire market. At that time, you will be like a guerrilla in an open field, and you will be wiped out by the regular army. 

## "Tools"

Most of the time, you don't need a fully functional computer (a computer that can run software). All you need is a device with a keyboard, screen, browser, and possibly a wireless network card.

I have also thought that since performance and portability cannot be achieved simultaneously, why not put the computing and rendering work that consumes performance on the cloud, while the user terminal only needs a processor with basic performance, as well as interactive devices such as screens, keyboards and mice. Moreover, mapping cloud servers to terminals in a one-to-many manner can not only save costs, but also achieve seamless switching and adapt to more scenarios. You can use a large screen at home and a tablet outside.

The main problems currently are connection speed and cost.
