![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20230304192541.png)

**CasaOS** is a simple, easy-to-use, and elegant open-source personal panel that includes features such as a file manager, server status monitoring, terminal, Docker container management, and a built-in Docker app store.

## Deployment (shell)

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash
```

Default panel access address: <http://localhost:80>

Note: If deployed on a server with a reverse proxy assigned, it is recommended to change the panel access port in the settings and leave port 80 for Nginx.
