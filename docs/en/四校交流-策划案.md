Preparation materials:

- Ground glue (2 X 2) as a checkpoint (corner)
- Buffer treatment at the end point
- The endpoint is halfway through the blind road

### Process

- Two-minute preparation time
  - Same as the official competition
  - Load initial bullets
- Five-minute match time
  - **Deathmatch** or **attack and defense**
  - Infantry resurrects on the spot after 5 seconds and needs to withdraw from the battlefield to return to the supply area for healing and skill recovery
  - Heroes resurrect on the spot after 10 seconds and need to withdraw from the battlefield to return to the supply area for healing and skill recovery
    - Since the server cannot directly heal the robot, the server needs to reset the robot and then give experience points to restore it.
    - After the robot resurrects, it maintains the level, performance points, and experience points before death, and the health is restored to 20% of the maximum health. The robot gains a 100% defense bonus after resurrection, which lasts for 10 seconds.
  - Winning conditions
    1. The side that defeats the base wins
    2. The side with higher remaining base health percentage wins
    3. In case of a tie, the side with higher damage wins
- Two-minute rest time
  - Clean up the venue
  - Reset obstacles
  - Clean up bullets
  - Robots return to the supply area
  - Robots return unused bullets

### Bullet Capacity

![](https://f004.backblazeb2.com/file/wiki-media/img/20210324150850.png)

In one game, the sentry robot can use 500 rounds of 17mm bullets.

### Upgrade Mechanism
