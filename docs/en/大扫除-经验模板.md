# Big Cleaning - Experience Template

Every time we do a big cleaning, our team is generally responsible for the indoor area of B3-401, two freshmen areas, the outer corridors of B3-401 and 402, the assembly room, the processing room material room, and the inside and outside of the greenhouse classroom. 
The general content of the big cleaning is desktop organization (no plastic bottles, breakfast bags, snack bags, personal items should be neatly organized), floor cleaning (sweeping and mopping), cleaning the award platform (removing dust), and when leaders inspect, the windows should be wiped. 
Before the big cleaning, a sign-in is usually issued, and everyone must be present to participate.

The following is a reference content template.
