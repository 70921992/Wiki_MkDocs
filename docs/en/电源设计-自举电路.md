# Power Supply Design - Bootstrap Circuit

The bootstrap circuit, in simple terms, is a circuit that lifts itself up using a bootstrap capacitor to boost the voltage.

We often see bootstrap capacitors in circuits such as Buck converters and motor driver H-bridges. Taking N-MOS as an example, **the reason for the need for bootstrap is because $V_{ds}$ is small, which means it cannot meet the conduction condition of $V_{gs}>V_{(gs)gh}$, according to the principle that the voltage across a capacitor cannot change suddenly, a higher voltage can be generated by superimposing the gate voltage, thus making the MOSFET conductive.**

Compared to other boost topologies, the bootstrap circuit has the advantages of low cost and simple circuit structure.

## Bootstrap Process

Next, let's analyze the bootstrap circuit in the half-bridge driver:

In the first stage (lower transistor drive stage, $Q_1$ is cut off, $Q_2$ is conductive), the bootstrap capacitor $C_B$ is charged. During this period, the charging current from $V_{DD}$ flows into the driver chip's $VDDA$, and through the charging loop of the capacitor, it flows from the bootstrap resistor $R_B$, diode $D_1$, capacitor $C_B$, and $Q_2$ to ground.

In the second stage (upper transistor drive stage, $Q_2$ is cut off, $Q_1$ is conductive), the voltage on the source of $Q_1$ (connected to GNDA pin) quickly rises to the drain voltage VDRAIN of $Q_1$. **Because the voltage across the capacitor cannot change suddenly**, the voltage on VDDA is equal to the source voltage of $Q_1$ plus the voltage across $C_B$ ($C_B$ has been charged to about VDD-0.7V). And because the voltage on the source of $Q_1$ (and GNDA) rises, diode $D_1$ becomes reverse biased and disconnects the connection between the VDD power supply and $C_B$. At this point, all the current required for the upper transistor drive stage is provided by $C_B$.
