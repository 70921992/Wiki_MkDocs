### Half-wave Dipole Antenna

The dipole antenna is the most basic form of antenna, with the half-wave (tuned) dipole antenna being the most representative. Its total length is slightly less than half a wavelength, and the input impedance when resonant is generally between 50~70Î© (depending on the ratio of its length to diameter), making it suitable for transmission lines and loads with a 50Î© standard impedance. The current distribution on the dipole antenna is shown in the red line in the figure below (approximately a sine curve):

The radiation pattern of the dipole antenna was mentioned in the previous article, and the radiation pattern in the reference plane (E plane) looks like the number "8", while the radiation pattern perpendicular to the axis (H plane) looks like a relatively uniform circle:

The limitation of the half-wave dipole antenna is that it only works at specific frequencies, because the antenna input impedance depends largely on the ratio of the antenna length to wavelength. Therefore, the problem of impedance mismatch becomes more pronounced as the antenna deviates further from the half-wave resonant frequency. The magnitude of the impedance change decreases as the ratio of length to diameter decreases, as shown in the figure below:
