## Basic Knowledge

Hardware Components:

- Main Controller (Dual IMU, Data Recorder, and Barometer), where CAN1 connects to GNSS-Compass module and DJI devices, and CAN2 connects to SDK devices; M1 - M8 connects to aircraft ESCs, and can communicate with DJI Intelligent ESCs through iESC port.
- GNSS-Compass module, including GPS/GLONASS dual-mode receiver and compass.
- Power Management Unit (PMU).
- LED module.

Flight Modes:

- P: Positioning mode, using GPS module or visual positioning system to achieve precise hovering of the aircraft.
- A: Attitude mode, without using GNSS and visual positioning system, only providing attitude stabilization. If GPS satellite signal is good, it can achieve return-to-home.
- S: Sport mode, based on automatic positioning mode, with increased sensitivity, and maximum attitude angle of 45°.
- G: Gentle mode, the aircraft moves more slowly in this mode, recommended for beginners.
- M: Manual mode, without using GNSS and visual positioning system, without attitude stabilization, and no attitude angle limit.

Return-to-Home Function: Intelligent/Low Voltage/Lost Control Return-to-Home

Protection Function: Lost Control Protection/Low Voltage Protection/Height and Distance Limitation/Special Area Flight Limitation/Output Power Loss Protection (only useful for hexacopters and above)/Power Protection/Built-in Dual IMU/Built-in Data Recorder/Heading Lock/Return-to-Home Lock

Flight Characteristics: Due to hardware differences, maximum wind resistance is 10 m/s, vertical hovering accuracy is ±0.5 m, horizontal hovering accuracy is ±1.5 m, and maximum yaw angular velocity is 150°/s.

## Hardware Installation

The main controller should be facing upwards and parallel to the aircraft body, with the recommended direction facing the front of the aircraft (if it is another direction, it needs to be set in the software), and installed as close to the center of gravity of the aircraft as possible.

The LED module can be installed on the lower side of the aircraft body for easy observation of the status during flight.

The PMU module should pay attention to heat dissipation.

## Hardware Debugging

### Compass Calibration

1. Quickly toggle the P/A mode switch 3 times, and the yellow light will be on, entering the calibration state.
2. Rotate the aircraft horizontally 360°, and the green light will be on.
3. Make the aircraft head down and rotate horizontally 360°.
4. At this time, the light is flashing normally, and the calibration is completed. If the red light is flashing, it needs to be recalibrated.

### Parameter Settings

- Basic Sensitivity (Pitch/Roll/Yaw): As large as possible, but not too large, too large will cause excessive feedback and high-frequency shaking in hovering state; on the contrary, if it is too small, it will cause longer response time (similar to network delay in games) and shaking.
- Throttle: As large as possible, but too large will cause takeoff and landing too fast and unsafe; too small will cause takeoff and landing too slow and affect the above parameters.
- Power Bandwidth: Different for different aircraft, too small will cause slow response and high-frequency shaking in hovering state (not enough power); too large will overcorrect and cause slow shaking when returning to center.
- Brake:
- Attitude Sensitivity (Brake/Attitude): The smaller the attitude sensitivity, the slower the attitude command follows the remote control command, and the attitude response is more gentle; the brake sensitivity describes the speed of the brake, the smaller the brake sensitivity, the longer the braking distance.
- Attitude Sensitivity: The larger the attitude sensitivity, the more violent the attitude response, and the smaller the response, the more sluggish.
