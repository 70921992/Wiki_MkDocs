# Power Supply Design - Ripple and Noise and Measurement Methods

## Ripple and Noise in Power Supplies

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220708164040.png)

Ripple is generated by the charging and discharging of the output filter capacitor and generally corresponds to the power supply operating frequency or its double (depending on the topology). Noise is usually superimposed at the inflection point of the ripple and is generated by parasitic effects each time the switch state changes. Ripple and noise are usually measured together in units of mVpp.

If a load requires a power supply with very low ripple and noise, a high-speed LDO is usually added after the output voltage, which requires a high PSRR value (above 70dB). For an introduction to PSRR and its measurement, please refer to the article [**Power Supply Design - LDO Power Supply Ripple Rejection Ratio (PSRR) and Measurement Methods**](https://wiki-power.com/%E7%94%B5%E6%BA%90%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1-LDO%E7%94%B5%E6%BA%90%E6%8A%91%E5%88%B6%E6%AF%94%EF%BC%88PSRR%EF%BC%89%E4%B8%8E%E6%B5%8B%E9%87%8F%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95).

## Test Methods

Precautions for measuring ripple and noise using an oscilloscope:

- Probe:
  - If possible, an active probe is recommended. Generally, a 1x probe is used (with a peak-to-peak value generally in the mV range to avoid measurement errors caused by attenuation of the oscilloscope probe).
  - Shorten the ground wire length and measure it in parallel with the output capacitor.
- Coupling mode: AC coupling
- Bandwidth: 20MHz
- Digital filter: Enable 1MHz capture and trigger
