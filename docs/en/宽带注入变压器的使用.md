# Usage of Broadband Injection Transformer ðŸš§

Broadband injection transformer is used to inject signals into circuits, such as control loops of switch power supplies, to achieve loop analysis of switch power supplies with loop analyzers. This article will explain using CYBERTEK's broadband injection transformer CK100 (2Hz-2MHz) as an example.

The basic parameters of the broadband injection transformer CK100 are as follows:

| Parameter                     | Specification    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Ratio                         | 1:1              |
| Bandwidth (-3dB)              | 2Hz-2MHz         |
| Isolation Voltage             | 600V CATIII      |
| Primary-Secondary Capacitance | 400pF@1kHz       |
| Maximum Secondary Current     | 10mA             |
| Operating Stability           | 0Â°C to 50â€‰Â°C     |
| Size                          | 85mm Ã—46mm Ã—30mm |
| Weight                        | 96g              |
