# Design of High-Speed Circuits ðŸš§

## Factors to Consider in High-Speed PCB Design

- Cost control
- Stack-up layout principles
- Layout principles
- Wiring principles
- Impedance design
- Signal integrity
- Power integrity
- EMC design
- Thermal design
- DFM design

## Differences Between Two-Layer and Multi-Layer Boards

- Calculation of reference plane and impedance
- Shorter return path on multi-layer boards
- Easier wiring
- Higher cost for multi-layer boards

## Stack-Up Specifications

- Components and soldering surfaces should be on a complete ground plane (shielding effect)
- Avoid adjacent parallel wiring layers as much as possible (to avoid mutual interference)
- All signal layers should be adjacent to the ground plane; critical signals should be adjacent to the ground layer and not cross the split area (to reduce the return path)

Therefore, the recommended stack-up scheme is:

- Top layer: Signal 1
- Middle layer 1: Ground
- Middle layer 2: Power
- Bottom layer: Signal 2

To reduce edge radiation, the power layer should be pulled back by at least 1 mm relative to the ground layer.

## PCB Impedance Design Requirements for Different Communication Protocols

## Some Basic Concepts

- **Signal Integrity**: Signal Integrity refers to the quality of the signal on the signal line. Good Signal Integrity means that the signal has the necessary voltage level when needed.
- **Transmission Line**: A connection line composed of two conductors with a certain length of loop is called a transmission line, sometimes also called a delay line. Its current returns to ground or power supply. The basic characteristics of a transmission line are characteristic impedance and signal propagation delay.
- **Lumped Circuit**: In general circuit analysis, all circuit parameters such as
