# RF - Resonant Circuits - Resonance of Lossless Components

In previous chapters, we mentioned resonance in parasitic components of basic electronic components. In this chapter, we will explore the reasons for resonance and how to utilize it.

## Resonance of Lossless Components

From the voltage divider rule in the above diagram, we can see that when an impedance component with impedance $Z_p$ is placed at the output of a generator with internal resistance $R_s$, the maximum output voltage that can be achieved by the circuit is:

$$
V_{out}=\frac{Z_p}{R_s+Z_p}(V_{in})
$$

Therefore, $V_{out}$ is always less than $V_{in}$. If $Z_p$ is an impedance that is frequency-dependent (such as capacitive or inductive reactance), then $V_{out}$ will also be frequency-dependent, and the ratio of $V_{out}$ to $V_{in}$ is the gain (or loss in this case) of the circuit, which also depends on frequency. For example, if we use a 25pF capacitor as the impedance component:

And plot the function of $V_{out}/V_{in}$ (in dB) versus frequency:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220418095324.png)

According to the following formula:

$$
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=20\log_{10} \frac{X_C}{R_s+X_C}
$$

Where $\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}$ is the loss expressed in dB; $R_s$ represents the source impedance; $X_C$ represents capacitive reactance, $X_C=\frac{1}{j\omega C}$.

The loss of this RC circuit increases with increasing frequency. This forms a simple low-pass filter. It should be noted that for every doubling of frequency, the attenuation slope will decrease at a rate of 6 dB. This is due to the single reactive component in the circuit. As we will see later, for every important reactive component added to the circuit, the attenuation slope will increase by an additional 6 dB.

If we replace the capacitor in the circuit with a 0.05ÂµH inductor:

We can plot the following curve:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220418101522.png)

Based on the following formula:

$$
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=20\log_{10} \frac{X_L}{R_s+X_L}
$$

Where $X_L$ represents inductive reactance, $X_L=j\omega L$.

Here, a simple high-pass filter with a final attenuation slope of 6 dB/octave is formed.

Using the formula from earlier, we can plot the frequency response of two independent and opposite reactive components. If we combine the inductor and capacitor at the source end to form an LC circuit:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220418103702.png)

We will get the following curve:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220418103931.png)

Calculated based on the following formula:

$$
\because V_{out}=\frac{X_{total}}{R_s+X_{total}}(V_{in})
$$

$$
\because X_{total}=\frac{X_C*X_L}{X_C+X_L}
$$

$$
\because X_C=\frac{1}{j\omega C}
$$

$$
\because X_L=j\omega L
$$

$$
\therefore \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=\frac{j\omega L}{(R_s-\omega^2 R_s L C)+j\omega L}
$$

If expressed in dB, it can be represented as:

$$
\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}= 20\log_{10} | \frac{j\omega L}{(R_s-\omega^2 R_s L C)+j\omega L}  |
$$

In the above curve, as we approach the resonant frequency of the tuning circuit, the slope of the resonance curve increases to 12 dB/octave because both reactive elements are changing at a rate of 6 dB/octave and are tilted in opposite directions. However, as we move away from resonance in either direction, the curve stabilizes again to a slope of 6 dB/octave because only one reactive element is active and the other presents a very high impedance to the circuit at these frequencies and is virtually negligible in the circuit.

RLC filters can be used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the total spectrum of ambient radio waves as a bandpass filter.
