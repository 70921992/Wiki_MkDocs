# RF - Components and Systems - Resistors

Resistors are a property of conductive media. In AC environments, resistors sometimes still exhibit their DC properties (for example, in the bias network of a transistor), which can potentially damage the RF operating point of the circuit.

## Equivalent Circuit of Resistors

In RF circuits, the equivalent model of a resistor is as follows:

In the figure, R represents the resistor itself, L represents the equivalent inductance of the pin, and C is a combination of parasitic capacitance (which varies depending on the structure of the resistor). Generally, carbon film resistors have poor high-frequency performance because they are composed of dense dielectric particles or carbon particles, and there is a small parasitic capacitance between each pair of carbon particles. These parasitic effects are important components of the equivalent circuit.

Wire-wound resistors also have problems in RF circuits. These resistors often exhibit varying impedance at high frequencies, especially for small resistance values in the 10MHz-200MHz frequency range. The parasitic inductance of wire-wound resistors is larger than that of carbon film resistors, and the inductance value can be approximately calculated using the formula for single-layer air-core inductance (which will be mentioned below). Because the inductance characteristics of wire-wound resistors are obvious, their impedance will increase with increasing frequency. At a certain frequency ($F_r$), the inductance ($L$) will resonate with the parallel capacitance ($C$), producing a peak impedance. After the peak, as the frequency increases, the impedance decreases instead, as shown in the following figure:

Metal film resistors can exhibit the best characteristics within the frequency range, although their equivalent circuit is the same as that of carbon film and wire-wound resistors, the values of each parasitic element in the equivalent circuit will be reduced.

As shown in the figure, the impedance of metal film resistors begins to decrease roughly above 10MHz due to the parallel capacitance in the equivalent circuit. However, at very high frequencies or very low resistance values (50Î©), the impedance is affected by the pin inductance and skin effect. The pin inductance produces a resonant peak, while the skin effect affects the slope of the curve.
