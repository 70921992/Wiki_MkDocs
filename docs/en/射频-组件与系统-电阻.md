# RF - Components and Systems - Resistors

Resistance is a property of conductive materials. In an AC environment, resistors sometimes still exhibit their DC characteristics, such as in bias networks for transistors, which can potentially disrupt the RF operating point of a circuit.

## Equivalent Circuit of a Resistor

In RF circuits, the equivalent model for a resistor is as follows:

In this diagram, R represents the resistance itself, L represents the equivalent inductance of the leads, and C is a combination of parasitic capacitance (which varies depending on the resistor's construction). Generally, carbon film resistors have poor high-frequency performance because they are composed of dense dielectric or carbon particles, with a small parasitic capacitance between each pair of carbon particles. These parasitic effects are essential components of the equivalent circuit.

Wirewound resistors can also pose problems in RF circuits. These resistors often exhibit varying impedance at high frequencies, especially for small resistance values within the 10MHz-200MHz frequency range. The parasitic inductance of wirewound resistors is larger than that of carbon film resistors, and the inductance value can be approximately calculated using a single-layer air-core inductance formula (mentioned below). Because the characteristics of inductance in wirewound resistors are apparent, their impedance increases with increasing frequency. At a specific frequency ($F_r$), the inductance ($L$) will resonate with the parallel capacitance ($C$), creating a peak in impedance. Beyond this peak, as the frequency continues to increase, the impedance decreases, as shown in the following graph:

Metal film resistors exhibit optimal characteristics over a range of frequencies. Although their equivalent circuit is similar to that of carbon film and wirewound resistors, the values of the parasitic elements in the equivalent circuit are lower.

As shown in the graph, the impedance of metal film resistors begins to decrease at approximately 10MHz due to the parallel capacitance in the equivalent circuit. However, at very high frequencies or very low resistance values (50Î©), the impedance is affected by lead inductance, which results in a resonance peak, and the skin effect, which affects the slope of the curve.
