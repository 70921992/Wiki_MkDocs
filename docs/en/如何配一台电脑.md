# How to Build a Computer

## 1. Choosing a Case

Notes:

- Power supply must be bottom-mounted
- Back cable management design is preferred
- For daily use, a small case or mid-tower is suitable

## 2. Choosing a Motherboard/CPU

Refer to the [**CPU hierarchy chart**](http://www.lotpc.com/tag/5923_1.html) and select according to your needs. Notes:

- For the same price, choose Intel for gaming and AMD for non-gaming
- CPUs can be bought separately (usually without counterfeit products), but a separate heatsink must be provided
- If providing a separate heatsink, be aware of the CPU heatsink height limit of the case

After selecting the CPU, choose a motherboard. Notes:

- AMD chips should be paired with AMD motherboards, and Intel chips should be paired with Intel motherboards
- Be aware of the compatible motherboard size for the case (ATX, Micro-ATX, MINI-ITX)

Motherboard/CPU combos can be more cost-effective.

## 3. Choosing a Graphics Card

Refer to the [**graphics card hierarchy chart**](http://www.lotpc.com/tag/5921_1.html) and select according to your needs. Notes:

- If the CPU has integrated graphics and the configuration requirements are not high, a dedicated graphics card is not necessary
- Those with NVIDIA chips are called N cards, while those with AMD chips are called A cards
- For the same price, use A cards for graphic rendering work and N cards for gaming
- N cards have a wider range of high-end models and lower power consumption, while A cards have a higher cost-performance ratio
- Be aware of the graphics card length limit of the case

## 4. Choosing Memory

Basic requirements for memory:

- DDR4 2400 frequency
- Be aware of the difference between desktop and laptop memory
- For basic use, 16GB is recommended, while 32GB or more is recommended for high-performance use
- Be aware of the number of memory slots on the motherboard
- Kingston and Samsung memory are recommended

## 5. Choosing a Hard Drive

Hard drives are divided into solid-state drives (SSD) and mechanical drives (HDD). Because SSDs are more expensive and have higher transfer rates than HDDs for the same capacity, the system and software are usually stored on SSDs, while infrequently used and large data documents are stored on HDDs.

Basic requirements for SSDs:

- M.2 interface (NVMe protocol)
- Select capacity according to your needs
- Be aware of the read and write speeds
- Samsung SSDs are recommended

Basic requirements for HDDs:

- SATA 3.0 interface
- 7200rpm speed
- Theoretical transfer rate of 6Gbit/s
- Select capacity according to your needs
- Seagate HDDs are recommended

## 6. Choosing a Power Supply

Notes:

- Select according to the size limit of the case
- (Starting at 300W) Add up the power consumption of all hardware and add 100W redundancy
- Be aware of the conversion efficiency: white, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, and titanium in increasing order of price and decreasing order of electricity cost

## 7. Other Accessories

Wireless module

- Preferably supports Wi-Fi 6
- Be aware of the interface type

Boot card

- Be aware of the interface type
