# How to Build a Computer

## 1. Choose a Computer Case

Notes:

- The power supply should be placed at the bottom.
- Look for a case with good cable management at the back.
- For everyday use, a small case or mid-tower is more suitable.

## 2. Choose a Motherboard / CPU

Refer to the [**CPU Hierarchy Chart**](http://www.lotpc.com/tag/5923_1.html) and choose accordingly. Notes:

- For the same price range, choose Intel for gaming and AMD for non-gaming purposes.
- CPUs can be bought separately (usually no counterfeit products), but you need to provide your own CPU cooler.
- If you have your own CPU cooler, make sure it fits within the height limit of the case.

After selecting the CPU, choose a motherboard. Notes:

- Pair AMD chips with AMD motherboards and Intel chips with Intel motherboards.
- Pay attention to the compatible motherboard sizes for your case (ATX, Micro-ATX, MINI-ITX).

You can also consider buying a motherboard/CPU combo for better value.

## 3. Choose a Graphics Card

Refer to the [**Graphics Card Hierarchy Chart**](http://www.lotpc.com/tag/5921_1.html) and choose accordingly. Notes:

- If your CPU has integrated graphics and your requirements are not high, a dedicated graphics card is not necessary.
- Graphics cards using NVIDIA chips are called "N cards," while those using AMD chips are called "A cards."
- For the same price range, choose A cards for graphic rendering work and N cards for gaming.
- N cards have a wider range of high-end models with lower power consumption, while A cards offer better cost performance.
- Pay attention to the maximum length of the graphics card supported by your case.

## 4. Choose Memory Modules (RAM)

Basic requirements for memory modules:

- DDR4 with a frequency of 2400.
- Differentiate between desktop and laptop memory modules.
- For basic usage, go for 16GB; for high-performance needs, choose 32GB or more.
- Consider the number of memory slots on your motherboard.
- Recommended brands: Kingston and Samsung.

## 5. Choose a Hard Drive

Hard drives are divided into solid-state drives (SSD) and mechanical drives (HDD). Since SSDs are more expensive and have higher transfer rates compared to HDDs of the same capacity, it is common to store the operating system and software on SSDs, while less frequently used large files and documents are stored on HDDs.

Basic requirements for SSDs:

- M.2 interface (NVMe protocol).
- Choose the capacity according to your needs.
- Compare read and write speeds.
- Recommended brand: Samsung.

Basic requirements for HDDs:

- SATA 3.0 interface.
- 7200rpm rotational speed.
- Theoretical transfer rate of 6Gbit/s.
- Choose the capacity according to your needs.
- Recommended brand: Seagate.

## 6. Choose a Power Supply

Notes:

- Choose a power supply that fits within the dimensions of your case.
- (Starting from 300W) Add up the power consumption of all hardware components and add an additional 100W for redundancy.
- Pay attention to the efficiency rating: white, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, titanium (in increasing order of efficiency). The higher the rating, the more expensive the power supply, but the more energy-efficient it is.

## 7. Other Accessories

Wireless module:

- It is best to support Wi-Fi 6.
- Pay attention to the interface type.

Boot card:

- Pay attention to the interface type.
