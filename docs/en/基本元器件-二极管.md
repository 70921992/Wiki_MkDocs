# Basic Components - Diode

Voltage-Current Characteristics:

- The voltage drop after conduction is about 0.7 V (LED is about 1-2 V, current is 5-20 mA).
- It does not conduct in reverse, but if the reverse breakdown voltage is reached, it will conduct (exceeding the maximum reverse voltage may burn out).
- It does not conduct when the forward voltage is very small (it only conducts when it is above 0.5 V).

## Main Parameters of Diodes

- **Maximum Rectification Current $I_F$**: represents the maximum average forward current allowed for long-term operation, exceeding which may burn out due to excessive junction temperature.
- **Maximum Reverse Working Voltage $U_R$**: the maximum reverse voltage that can be applied, exceeding which may cause breakdown. ($U_R$ is usually half of the breakdown voltage)
- **Reverse Current $I_R$**: the reverse current when not broken down, the smaller the better the conductivity.
- **Maximum Operating Frequency $f_M$**: upper cutoff frequency. Due to the effect of junction capacitance, it may not well reflect the unidirectional conductivity beyond this frequency.

## Classification of Diodes

Types:

- **Rectifier**
  - **Ordinary Diode**: relatively slow recovery speed, not suitable for high-frequency circuits.
  - **Fast Recovery Diode**
  - **Schottky Diode**: used in scenes below 200V.
- **Voltage Regulator Diode**: continuous breakdown, used in low-power scenarios.
  - **TVS**: instantaneous breakdown, used in high-power scenarios.

### Rectifier Diode

Usage: Use unidirectional conductivity to convert AC into pulsating DC.

### Fast Recovery Diode (FRD)

The structure and function of the fast recovery diode are the same as those of the rectifier diode. The rectifier diode is used for low-frequency applications below 500 Hz, while the FRD is used for high-frequency switches from several kilohertz to 100 kHz. Therefore, FRD has the characteristic of a very short reverse recovery time (trr), which is very important for high-speed switches. Generally, the trr of a rectifier diode is several microseconds to tens of microseconds, while the trr of an FRD is several tens of nanoseconds to several hundred nanoseconds, about 1/100 of the rectifier diode. It is used in switching power supplies, inverters, DC/DC converters, etc.

### Voltage Regulator (Zener) Diode

Definition: A diode that can stabilize a certain voltage.

The voltage regulator diode utilizes the reverse characteristics of the PN junction. It continues to break down and obtains a constant voltage, which is used in low-power scenarios.

Voltage stabilization conditions:

1. Working in a reverse breakdown state.
2. The reverse voltage is greater than the voltage stabilization voltage.

Parameters of voltage regulator diodes:

- **Stabilization Voltage $U_Z$**: represents the reverse breakdown voltage under a specified current. For the same type of voltage regulator diode, the stabilization voltage is a fixed value.
- **Reverse Current $I_Z$**: reference current when working in a voltage stabilization state. When the current is lower than this value, the voltage stabilization effect deteriorates, also known as ${I_Z}_{min}$.
- **Rated Power $P_{ZM}$**: equal to the product of the stabilization voltage $U_Z$ and the maximum stabilization current $I_{ZM}$. Exceeding this value may cause damage due to excessive junction temperature. As long as it does not exceed the rated power, the larger the current, the better the voltage stabilization effect.

Selection of limiting resistor:

In the voltage stabilization circuit, a limiting resistor needs to be connected in series to protect the voltage regulator diode (used to divide the voltage difference between the input voltage and the stabilization voltage). The voltage at both ends of the resistor is the difference between the input voltage and the stabilization voltage, and the current is the total current of the load circuit plus the minimum and maximum ${I_Z}$ of the voltage regulator diode.

### Transient Voltage Suppressor (TVS)

TVS is used to prevent transient high-energy shocks and protect precision components. TVS has both unidirectional and bidirectional types. The characteristics of a unidirectional TVS are similar to those of a voltage regulator diode, and the characteristics of a bidirectional TVS are equivalent to two reverse-connected voltage regulator diodes.

TVS is connected in parallel in the circuit, and under normal circumstances, the current does not go through the TVS branch, and the TVS exhibits the unidirectional conductivity of a diode:

When overvoltage occurs, the TVS enters breakdown and diverts the current to the ground, keeping the voltage of the subsequent circuit at the clamping voltage of the diode:

Usage:

- When added to signal and power lines, it can prevent electrostatic discharge, AC surges, or noise.
- It can release pulses of over 10,000 V and 60 A for 10 ms, preventing component damage or interference caused by switching between buses.
- Placed between the signal line and ground, it avoids interference with data and control buses.

Main parameters of TVS diodes:

- **Reverse breakdown voltage VRWM and reverse leakage current IR**: VRWM indicates the highest voltage at which the TVS diode does not conduct, and there is only a small reverse leakage current IR at this voltage.
- **Breakdown voltage VBR**: The voltage at which the TVS diode conducts when tested with a specified current, indicating the voltage at which the TVS diode conducts.
- **Peak pulse current IPP**: The maximum peak current allowed by the TVS diode for a 10/1000μs wave (the peak current of an 8/20μs wave is about 5 times that), exceeding this current value may cause permanent damage. In the same series, the higher the breakdown voltage of the diode, the smaller the peak current allowed to pass, generally a few amps to tens of amps.
- **Maximum clamping voltage VC**: The voltage presented across the two ends of the TVS diode when the peak pulse current IPP flows through it.
- **Peak pulse power Pm**: $Pm=IPP*VC$. At a given maximum clamping voltage, the greater the power consumption PM, the greater the surge current carrying capacity, and at a given power consumption PM, the lower the clamping voltage, the greater the surge current carrying capacity.
- **Steady-state power P0**: TVS diodes can also be used as voltage regulators, in which case steady-state power is used.
- **Junction capacitance Cj**: Like varistors, the junction capacitance Cj of TVS diodes is also large, and unidirectional capacitance is larger than bidirectional capacitance. The larger the power, the larger the capacitance, and the junction capacitance affects the response time of the TVS diode.

Differences between TVS diodes and Zener diodes:

TVS diodes absorb high overvoltage in a short time to protect subsequent circuits, while Zener diodes clamp the input voltage to a constant voltage and provide the clamped constant voltage to subsequent circuits.

### Switching diodes

Diodes customized for switching design, with short cutoff/conduction switching times to prevent reverse current from damaging precision components.

Example:

The 1N4148 in the figure serves as protection. When a negative voltage is applied to the right side, it can conduct to ground, protecting the three-terminal regulator.

### Schottky diodes (SBD)

Schottky diodes are devices that combine semiconductors and metals rather than PN junctions (trr will increase with temperature). Due to their low forward voltage and short reverse recovery time, they are suitable for high-speed switching applications.

## Forward and reverse bias

- **Forward bias**: P is connected to a high potential and N is connected to a low potential, and the current flows in the direction of the PN junction, showing its unidirectional conductive performance.
- **Reverse bias**: The opposite is true, forming a reverse current flowing from the N region to the P region. The PN junction under reverse bias is usually considered non-conductive and is basically in a cutoff state.
