# How to Write WeChat Articles Using Markdown

In the article "Efficient Writing with Markdown" [**使用 Markdown 进行高效写作**](https://wiki-power.com/en/%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8Markdown%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E9%AB%98%E6%95%88%E5%86%99%E4%BD%9C), we learned about the convenience of using Markdown for typesetting. But how can we use it to write articles on WeChat?

As we all know, WeChat uses a rich text editor that cannot directly parse Markdown syntax. However, we can first parse Markdown into rich text and then paste it into the editor of our WeChat article.

[**MD2WeChat**](https://md2wechat.wiki-power.com/) is a web tool that I customized based on the open-source project [lyricat/wechat-format](https://github.com/lyricat/wechat-format). It can easily parse Markdown syntax into rich text:

Simply paste your Markdown article into the left column, and then click "Copy" in the right column to paste it into the editor of your WeChat article.

Note: External links will be automatically footnoted and attached at the bottom of the article because WeChat articles do not allow external links.
