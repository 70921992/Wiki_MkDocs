# DIY CMSIS-DAP ðŸš§

CMSIS DAP is an open-source emulator launched by ARM, which supports all Cortex-ARM devices and JTAG/SWD interfaces. In the latest firmware version, it also supports single-wire SWO interfaces, which can directly output corresponding data to the debugging window through the SWO interface in the program, serving a similar purpose as serial debugging. DAP has the following features:

1. Completely open-source, with no license restrictions, so the corresponding price will be very cheap
2. Plug and play, no need for drivers
3. The latest version of DAP integrates a serial port, which can be used as a USB-to-serial module in addition to downloading and debugging, serving two purposes with one device
4. Performance can already meet the needs of general users

## Background

CMSIS-DAP/DAP-Link has the following advantages over J-Link/ST-Link:

- Completely open-source, no legal risks
- Supports virtual serial port
- Driver-free
- DAPLink is CMSIS-DAP, supporting USB drag-and-drop burning/firmware upgrade

## Hardware Part

### MCU

#### Crystal Oscillator

We chose Murata's 8MHz passive crystal oscillator, model CSTCE8M00G53-R0, packaged in 3213, with a capacitance of 15pF. Why did we choose this one? Because it is relatively small in size and integrates the two oscillation capacitors, which can save a lot of trouble in hardware design. As for the naming convention of Murata crystal oscillator models, please refer to the table below:

### Power Supply

### Functional Module

## Software Part

### Driver

No manual driver installation is required on Win10/MacOS/Linux; Win8 and older systems require manual driver installation.

### Drag-and-Drop Download (MSC)

Simply drag and drop the compiled `.hex` or `.bin` file into DAPLink's virtual U disk to complete the burning. If an error occurs, the error message will be stored in `FAIL.txt`.

### Virtual Serial Port (CDC)

The CDC virtual serial port function has general serial port functions, allowing bidirectional communication and sending interrupt commands to reset the target board.
