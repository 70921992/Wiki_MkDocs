# RF - Resonant Circuits - Basic Definitions

In this section, we will study parallel resonant circuits and their characteristics in RF, the concept of load Q and its relationship with source impedance and load impedance, as well as the losses of components and how they affect the circuit. Finally, we will show some coupled resonant circuits.

Resonant circuits are applied in every transmitter, receiver, and test equipment in RF circuits, selectively transmitting a certain frequency or group of frequencies from the source to the load while attenuating all other frequencies outside of the passband. An ideal resonant circuit looks like this:

It is a perfect rectangular passband, attenuating wireless signals below or above the target bandwidth while allowing signals within the target bandwidth to pass without interference. However, due to the physical properties of the components that make up the filter, a perfect filter is impossible, but we can design non-ideal filters that meet the requirements.

## Bandwidth

Bandwidth generally refers to the half-power bandwidth, which is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies ($f_2-f_1$) where the amplitude response is 3dB lower than the passband response, as shown in the figure:

## Meaning and Calculation of dB

dB is a relative value that can represent large or small numbers briefly. For example, if we want to represent a power change of 100000000 times, we only need to write +80dB.

$$
dB=10\lg(\frac{P_1}{P_0})
$$

where $P_1$ represents the current power and $P_0$ represents the reference power. If $P_1$ is twice $P_0$, then:

$$
10\lg(\frac{P_1}{P_0})=10\lg2=3dB
$$

If $P_1$ is half of $P_0$, then:

$$
10\lg(\frac{P_1}{P_0})=10\lg\frac{1}{2}=10\lg2^{-1}=-3dB
$$

Similarly, +10dB represents a 10-fold increase in power, and -10dB represents a decrease in power to 1/10.

3dB often appears in power or error rate diagrams, indicating that +3dB represents a doubling of power, and -3dB represents a halving of power.

## dBm and dBw

dBm and dBw are obtained by replacing the reference power P0 in the dB formula with 1 mW and 1 W, respectively:

$$
dBm=10\lg(\frac{P_1}{1mW})
$$

$$
dBw=10\lg(\frac{P_1}{1W})
$$

Since 1 mW and 1 W are both fixed values, dBm and dBw can both represent the absolute value of power.

There is a conversion table for current power and dBm/dBw usage:

| watt         | dBm       | dBw         |
| :----------- | :-------- | :---------- |
| 0.1 pW       | -100 dBm  | -130 dBW    |
| 1 pW         | -90 dBm   | -120 dBW    |
| 10 pW        | -80 dBm   | -110 dBW    |
| 100 pW       | -70 dBm   | -100 dBW    |
| 1 nW         | -60 dBm   | -90 dBW     |
| 10 nW        | -50 dBm   | -80 dBW     |
| 100 nW       | -40 dBm   | -70 dBW     |
| 1 μW         | -30 dBm   | -60 dBW     |
| 10 μW        | -20 dBm   | -50 dBW     |
| 100 μW       | -10 dBm   | -40 dBW     |
| 794 μW       | -1 dBm    | -31 dBW     |
| **1.000 mW** | **0 dBm** | **-30 dBW** |
| 1.259 mW     | 1 dBm     | -29 dBW     |
| 10 mW        | 10 dBm    | -20 dBW     |
| 100 mW       | 20 dBm    | -10 dBW     |
| 1 W          | 30 dBm    | 0 dBW       |
| 10 W         | 40 dBm    | 10 dBW      |
| 100 W        | 50 dBm    | 20 dBW      |
| 1 kW         | 60 dBm    | 30 dBW      |
| 10 kW        | 70 dBm    | 40 dBW      |
| 100 kW       | 80 dBm    | 50 dBW      |
| 1 MW         | 90 dBm    | 60 dBW      |
| 10 MW        | 100 dBm   | 70 dBW      |

Among them, the most commonly used is 1 W = 30 dBm.

## dBi, dBd, and dBc

The calculation method of dBi, dBd, and dBc is similar to dB, which represents the relative value of power, but the meaning represented by the reference baseline $P_0$ is different.

| dBx                    | Reference Baseline |
| :--------------------- | :----------------- |
| dBi (Decibe-Isotropic) | Isotropic antenna  |
| dBd (Decibe-Dipole)    | Dipole antenna     |
| dBc (Decibe-Carrier)   | Carrier            |

For the same gain, dBi is generally 2.15 larger than dBd, which is due to the different directionalities of the two antennas.

## Quality Factor (Q) of Resonant Circuit

This Q is different from the Q defined in the previous article. Q is a measure of the selectivity of a resonant circuit. The higher the Q value, the narrower the bandwidth and the higher the selectivity of the resonant circuit. The formula for Q is defined as follows:

$$
Q=\frac{f_e}{f_2-f_1}
$$

## Shape Factor (SF)

The shape factor of a resonant circuit is usually defined as the ratio of the 60dB bandwidth to the 3dB bandwidth. For example, if the 60dB bandwidth $f_4-f_3$ is 3 MHz and the 3dB bandwidth $f_2-f_1$ is 1.5 MHz, the shape factor is:

$$
SF=\frac{3MHz}{1.5MHz}=2
$$

Shape factor is a way to measure the steepness of the skirt. The smaller the number, the steeper the skirt response. The shape factor of a perfect filter is 1, which is the ultimate value. The passband with a shape factor less than 1 is shown in the following figure, but this is physically impossible:

## Ultimate Attenuation

Refers to the difference between the peak attenuation outside the passband and the passband. Due to the actual physical characteristics of the components, the ultimate attenuation cannot be infinite.

## Insertion Loss

Refers to the attenuation loss caused by the components between the signal source segment and the end. In the case of impedance mismatch, some signals at the source end will be absorbed by these components due to their resistive nature, and the attenuation caused here is called insertion loss, expressed in dB.

## Ripple

Ripple represents the flatness of the resonant circuit passband, expressed in dB. Its value is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum attenuation in the passband.
