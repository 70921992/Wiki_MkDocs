# Push-Pull and Open-Drain Outputs

Generally, the pins of a microcontroller have a driving circuit that can be configured with different types of digital and analog interfaces. The output mode generally has push-pull and open-drain outputs.

## Push-Pull Output

Push-pull output can output two levels, one is push (current pulling, outputting high level), and the other is pull (current sinking, outputting low level). Push-pull output can be implemented using a pair of switches, usually using transistors or field-effect transistors in the chip.

As shown in the figure, they are push and pull, and the detailed process is:

- Push: When the input signal is low, the P-MOS conducts, and the current passes from VDD through it to the output pin. At this time, the N-MOS is cut off.
- Pull: When the input signal is high, the N-MOS conducts, and the current passes from the output pin through it to GND. At this time, the P-MOS is cut off.

Push-pull operation does not allow multiple devices to be connected together in a bus configuration, only unidirectional line interfaces (such as SPI, UART). If two push-pull output structures are connected together, and one outputs a high level, that is, the upper tube conducts and the lower tube is closed; at the same time, the other outputs a low level, that is, the upper tube is closed and the lower tube conducts. The current will flow directly from VCC of the first pin through the upper tube and then through the lower tube of the second pin to GND. The resistance of the entire circuit is very small, which may cause a short circuit and damage the port. This is also why push-pull output cannot achieve line-AND.

Push-pull output has higher driving capability because it can drive high and low levels, and has better rising/falling edges (larger slope) in digital signals, which means better performance.

Push-pull output can also be configured as an input mode by turning off the upper and lower tubes, which is in a high-impedance state on the line.

## Open-Drain Output

Open-drain (OD, Open Drain Output) refers to opening the drain of the MOS tube. Historically, there was also open-collector output (OC, Open Collect Output).

The most primitive open-drain output has only two states: low and high impedance. If a high level needs to be output, an external pull-up resistor is required.

The most primitive open-drain output is implemented using an N-MOS tube. When the input signal is high, the output pin is pulled low to ground; but when the input signal is low, the output pin is in a high-impedance floating state.

The main feature of open-drain output is that it has no driving capability for high levels and needs an external pull-up resistor to truly output high levels.

Open-drain output is commonly used in communication interfaces where multiple devices are connected to the same line (such as I2C, One-Wire). The line is pulled up to a high level by default by a pull-up resistor. When any device triggers a signal, the entire line voltage is pulled low.

The pull-up resistor used for open-drain output must balance the following parameters:

- Edge slope: The line itself has capacitance, and the coupling of the pull-up resistor with it will form a low-pass filter, and different resistance values will affect the rise/fall edge slope. The smaller the resistance, the steeper the edge, and the better the signal transmission effect.
- Power consumption: If the resistance value of the pull-up resistor is too small, when the line is pulled up, it will cause excessive power consumption.
- Noise: If the resistance value of the pull-up resistor is too large, the pull-up will become weaker, and external interference noise will be more easily picked up by the line.

## Comparison

|                | Push-Pull Output | Open-Drain Output                       |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| High-level driving capability | High | Depends on external pull-up resistor |
| Low-level driving capability | High | High |
| Level transition speed | Fast | Determined by external pull-up resistor, the smaller the faster but the higher the power consumption |
| Line-AND | Not supported | Supported |
| Level conversion | Not supported | Supported |

- Push-pull output is generally used for one-way line communication; open-drain is usually used for two-way line communication.
- Because of the pull-up resistor, the power consumption of open-drain output is relatively high.
- Generally speaking, push-pull switching speed is faster than open-drain.
