# Signal Integrity - Distortion ðŸš§

The signal distortion problem on a single network can be divided into three aspects: **reflection, signal quality issues, and timing errors**.

## Reflection

The fundamental cause of reflection is **the instantaneous impedance change in the direction of signal propagation**. Possible sources of impedance changes include the end of the interconnect line, changes in the cross-sectional area of the trace, layer changes, gaps on the return path plane, additional components such as connectors, and wiring topology.

### Sources of Reflection

#### Reflection at Impedance Discontinuities

When the instantaneous impedance on a transmission line changes abruptly, some of the signal will reflect in the opposite direction, while the rest will continue to propagate but with a changed amplitude. The magnitude of the reflected signal depends on the amount of impedance change. Assuming the instantaneous impedance in the first region is $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ in the second region, the ratio of the reflected signal to the incident signal (reflection coefficient) is:

$$
\rho=\frac{V_{reflected}}{V_{incident}}=\frac{Z_2-Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}
$$

It can be seen that the greater the difference in impedance between the two regions, the greater the amount of reflected signal. For example, if a 1V signal propagates along a transmission line with a characteristic impedance of 50Î© and enters an area with a characteristic impedance of 75Î©, the calculated reflection coefficient is 20%, and the reflected voltage is 0.2V.

#### Reflection at Resistive Loads

There are three special cases for the termination matching of a transmission line: open circuit, short circuit, and matching. Assuming the characteristic impedance of the transmission line is 50Î© and the signal is transmitted from the source end to the far end with an input voltage of 1V:

In the case of an open circuit at the terminal, the instantaneous impedance at the end is infinite, and the reflection coefficient approaches 1 infinitely, which means that all the incident signals are reflected back along the source path. The sum of the voltage of the incident wave and the reflected wave at the open circuit is 2V.

In the case of a short circuit at the terminal (short-circuited with the return path), the impedance at the end is 0, and the reflection coefficient is -1. When the incident signal reaches the far end, it will produce a reflection signal of -1V, which propagates towards the source end, so the voltage here is 0.

In the case of matching the terminal impedance with the characteristic impedance (i.e., the terminal impedance is also 50Î©), the reflection coefficient is 0, and there is no reflected voltage. The voltage on the terminal is only the incident signal.

In general (50Î© impedance), the relationship between the impedance of region 2 and the reflection coefficient is roughly as shown in the following figure:

When the impedance of region 2 is less than that of region 1, the reflection coefficient is negative, and the reflected voltage is negative. Assuming the terminal resistive load is 25Î©, the reflection coefficient is -0.33, so there is a voltage of -0.33V reflected back to the source end, and the actual voltage on the terminal is 1+(-0.33)=0.67V.

### Reflection Diagram

If the transmission line delay, the impedance of each region through which the signal passes, and the initial voltage of the driver are known, the voltage at each reflection surface or at any time can be calculated.

Assuming the driver source voltage is 1V, the internal resistance is 10Î©, and the transmission line end is open circuit, the following reflection diagram and curve can be obtained based on the reflection formula:

### Forms of Reflection

Reflection usually manifests as overshoot, undershoot, and ringing.

#### Overshoot

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211220091443.png)

Overshoot refers to the first peak of oscillation, which can be positive or negative. The hazard is that it may cause device damage (greater than VCC or less than GND). In addition, positive overshoot will form a source of interference, causing crosstalk to other devices; negative overshoot will cause the negative voltage on the pin to forward bias the device PN substrate (parasitic diode), and a large current will fuse to produce an open circuit.

#### Ringing

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20211220094236.png)

Ringing refers to crossing the critical value of the voltage level multiple times, and it takes multiple repetitions to return to the normal voltage level.

The hazards of ringing are similar to those of multiple overshoots, and it is an uncertain state between high and low levels. The cause is improper impedance matching (too large or too small).

### Solutions to Reflection

The solution to reflection is to try to keep the impedance of the interconnect line constant. Specific measures include:



1. Use controllable impedance interconnects
2. Increase resistance matching, with the reference method being series resistors at the beginning or parallel resistors at the end
3. Use wiring rules that maintain constant impedance along the line topology and minimize branch length
4. Fine-tune the geometric characteristics of the lines, such as avoiding right angles or sharp angles
5. Avoid interference sources and coupling paths in PCB wiring

## Timing Errors

The delay difference between two or more signal paths is called skew. When there is unexpected skew between a signal line and a clock line, it may cause false triggering and logic errors; when there is skew between differential lines, some query signals may become common-mode signals, causing distortion.

The slow generation of signal edges may also be due to insufficient driving capability or excessive load (such as too high link impedance).

The methods to solve the slow generation of signal edges are:

1. Increase driving capability;
2. Reduce load.

Due to insufficient driving or excessive load, the slow generation of signal edges often accompanies the phenomenon of low signal amplitude.

## Rise Time Degradation

### Adverse Effects of Lossy Lines

After a rapidly changing edge signal passes through a section of actual transmission line, the rise time will be extended:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220105174702.png)

The signal quality problem caused by rise time degradation is due to frequency-dependent losses in the wire/dielectric, with higher frequency losses being greater than lower frequency losses, which can cause slow signal edges. When the rise time degradation approaches the unit interval of the signal, 1 bit of information will leak into the next or even several bits, causing data sampling errors. This effect is called intersymbol interference (ISI) and is the main cause of problems when the data rate is greater than or equal to 1Gbps.

If the rise time degradation causes the rise time to be extended to near the unit interval of the signal, intersymbol interference may occur:

The quality of high-speed signals can be evaluated using an eye diagram, which can measure bit error rate (the left diagram has slight loss, while the right diagram has greater loss):

### Losses in Transmission Lines

When a signal propagates along a transmission line, there are five ways in which energy is lost at the receiving end:

1. Radiation loss
2. Coupling to adjacent traces
3. Impedance mismatch
4. Wire loss
5. Dielectric loss
