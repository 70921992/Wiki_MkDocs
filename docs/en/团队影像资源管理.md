# Team Image Resource Management

This article uses the example of managing image data for a robot team. The team uses Synology NAS for data storage, which is more convenient for managing image resources, better managing user read and write permissions, and building various intelligent albums (timeline, face recognition, tags, location, etc.) compared to traditional folder management methods.

## Basic Operation Method

Open Synology Photos and follow these steps:

- **Albums divided by activity**: Click `Switch to folder mode` in the upper right corner, open the `2021 season` folder, create a folder named `date + activity name` (e.g. `201108 Change of Term Conference`, with a space between the numbers and Chinese characters for aesthetics), and upload photos to the folder.
- **Albums not divided by activity** (such as photos taken daily): Switch to timeline mode and drag and drop photos or videos directly into the interface for uploading.

## Technical Principle

Because Synology Photos creates the `/photo` folder by default and archives the photos uploaded in the Photos panel by year and month in the `/photo/PhotoLibrary` folder, we can place custom albums under the `/photo` directory for easy viewing of images in Synology Photos.

As shown in the figure, we created the `2021 season` folder under the `/photo` directory to store image resources by activity.

By using the `date + activity name` format, we can name each activity folder, such as `201108 Change of Term Conference`.

Why use folder archiving for albums instead of Synology Photos' built-in albums? This is because:

1. Synology Photos cannot export album information, so if a disk needs to be replaced or migrated, all album information will be lost.
2. It cannot be subdivided into levels. For example, in some activity album folders, it may be necessary to further subdivide into photographer folders, which Synology Photos cannot do.

After placing the image resources divided by activity under the `/photo` directory, open Synology Photos to browse them in a waterfall flow:

Of course, like mainstream intelligent albums, Synology Photos also has face recognition capabilities.

For image resources not divided by activity (such as daily photos), open Synology Photos, switch to timeline mode, and drag and drop photos to upload them locally. This way, the uploaded photos will be automatically archived by shooting date in the `/photo/PhotoLibrary` folder for easy storage and organization.
