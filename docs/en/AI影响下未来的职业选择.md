# Career Choices in the Age of AI

## Background

[**The future of employment**](http://sep4u.gr/wp-content/uploads/The_Future_of_Employment_ox_2013.pdf) evaluates over 700 occupations and concludes that half of them will disappear in the next decade. So, what are the specific situations for different types of occupations, and how should individuals respond? Let's take a closer look.

## Occupations that will disappear

**The first occupations to disappear are**: drivers, physical store clerks, referees, and general clerks. Among them, drivers of various transportation vehicles, including taxi drivers, truck drivers, and airline pilots, will be replaced by self-driving vehicles with fewer errors.

Their occupations are mostly **rule-based, with fewer technical points and high substitutability**.

**Occupations that will gradually disappear in the future**: doctors, brick-and-mortar programmers, firefighters, police officers, etc. Among them, doctors have high professional risks and human errors can have a significant impact. Brick-and-mortar programmers will be replaced by AI self-programming. For high-risk occupations such as firefighters and police officers, robots have obvious advantages, and AI can explore more possibilities in case handling than humans.

## Occupations that will not disappear

**Occupations that are difficult to disappear include**: judges, elementary school teachers, clergy, innovative designers, singers, etc. Among them, judges are difficult to replace due to ethical issues (machines cannot convict or decide life and death). In the enlightenment education stage, children need to be cultivated with a sense of independent learning and humanistic care, which requires teachers to lead. Clergy (priests, abbots, hosts, etc.) will definitely not be replaced.

The common characteristics of these occupations are **humanistic care, ethical principles, and innovation**.

## How to choose a career direction

In the future society, the three qualities required to work without being replaced by machines and AI are:

- Empathy
- Teamwork
- Storytelling ability

Empathy is the ability to **think from others' perspectives**. Often, demand does not come out on its own, but needs us to project our thinking onto others to explore demand, rather than just focusing on technical implementation.

Team collaboration is related to the "long tail effect". Modern society does not require everyone to fill in their weaknesses, but rather to focus on developing their own expertise and use team collaboration to make up for their weaknesses. Only by combining everyone's strengths can a team with long-term advantages be formed. Otherwise, if everyone develops in all areas but has mediocre qualifications, how can this team stand out from the competition?

The ability to tell stories is reflected in the need for a shared value understanding within a team and the ability to make others accept your ideas and use your products externally.

It is necessary to learn how to tell a story that all stakeholders can agree with. Value is not only influenced by the product itself, but also by the importance of promotion.

## Summary

The Luddite movement could not stop the tide of the Industrial Revolution. For ordinary people, individual power can never stop the trend of the times. Predicting the trend of the times, taking advantage of the situation, can lead to better personal development.
