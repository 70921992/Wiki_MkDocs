# Competition and Hazard in Digital Circuits

In digital circuits, there is a phenomenon of competition and hazard due to the delay in signal transmission and state transition.

## Causes

- **Competition**: In combinational logic circuits, when input signals from different paths change and are transmitted to the same gate circuit, there is a time difference.
- **Hazard**: Due to the existence of competition, the output signal needs some time to reach the expected state, and there may be momentary erroneous output during the transition period, such as a spike pulse.

Competition does not necessarily lead to hazard, but hazard always involves competition.

For example, for the same input signal A, signal A' will lag behind A when it reaches the AND gate due to passing through an inverter, causing interference pulses in the output of the AND gate:

## Solutions

The following methods can be used to eliminate the hazard phenomenon:

- Increase the output filter capacitor: Used to eliminate narrow pulses of hazard. However, the disadvantage is that it makes the waveform smoother, which can easily cause errors in high-speed signals.
- Delay reading the output value: Ignore the influence of narrow pulses.
