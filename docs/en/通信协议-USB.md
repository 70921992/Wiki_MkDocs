### Port Types

Data:

- **Downstream Facing Port (DFP)**: Host/Downstream hub port. A typical example is the traditional standard Type-A port.
- **Upstream Facing Port (UFP)**: Device/Upstream hub port. A typical example is the traditional standard Type-B port.
- **Dual-Role Port (DRP)**: A port that switches between DFP and UFP ports before a connection event occurs. After the initial connection event, dynamic swapping can be negotiated through the USB Power Delivery protocol.

Power:

- **Pull-up Current Power/Power Supply Device**: The pull-up current is up to 5A when 5V-20V. A typical example is the traditional standard Type-A port.
- **Sink Current Power/Power Consumption Device**: The sink current is up to 5A when 5V-20V. A typical example is the traditional standard Type-B port.

## Pin Definitions

Type-C has male and female heads (plugs and sockets), and most of the pins are distributed in a mirrored manner.

### CC Pin

The pull-up and pull-down resistors used on the CC pin depend on whether it is a downstream-facing port (DFP), upstream-facing port (UFP), or electronic marker/active cable. Port monitoring must always be used to achieve insertion and removal detection, direction detection, and current capability notification.

**Host/Downstream-Facing Port (DFP) uses pull-up resistors**. The pull-up resistor Rp must be connected to both CC1 and CC2 pins and pulled up to 3.3V/5V/current source. The value of the pull-up resistor will determine the device's power supply current capability through the port, as shown in the following table:

| DFP Power Supply Current Capability          | Pull-up to 4.75V~5.5V | Pull-up to 3.3VÂ±5% | Pull-up to 1.7~5.5V current source |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Default USB Power (USB2.0-500mA, USB3.0-900mA) | 56kâ„¦Â±20%              | 36kâ„¦Â±20%           | 80ÂµAÂ±20%                           |
| 1.5A@5V                                     | 22kâ„¦Â±5%               | 12kâ„¦Â±5%            | 180ÂµAÂ±8%                           |
| 3A@5V                                       | 10kâ„¦Â±5%               | 4.7kâ„¦Â±5%           | 330ÂµAÂ±8%                           |

**Device/Upstream-Facing Port (UFP) uses pull-down resistors or voltage clamps**. The value of the pull-down resistor Rd is always 5.1kâ„¦Â±10%.

Cable direction detection: If CC1 detects a valid pull-up or pull-down, it represents the forward direction (not reversed); if CC1 detects the opposite, it represents the reverse direction (reversed):
