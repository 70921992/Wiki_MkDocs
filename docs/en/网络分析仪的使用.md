# Usage of Network Analyzer ðŸš§

The network analyzer is a fundamental instrument for characterizing components used in RF and microwave systems.

## S Parameters

S parameters, also known as scattering parameters, are the language used by network analyzers. These parameters can fully describe any linear, time-invariant component and comprehensively depict the characteristics of the component in the system it may be connected to. Scattering parameters include phase information, so they are complex vectors that are also frequency-dependent. Once the S parameters are known, they can be converted into other network parameters for circuit design, optimization, or tuning.

## Calibration

Calibration must be performed before each use of the network analyzer.

The calibration method involves using standard calibration components (make sure to choose the correct model) to calibrate for open, short, and load conditions. The port extension function is used to click on the open for automatic calibration, which extends the signal detection to the end of the transmission line. Calibration is complete when the complex impedance values fall on the rightmost end of the Smith chart (open).
