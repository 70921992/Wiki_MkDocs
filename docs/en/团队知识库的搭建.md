# Building a Team Knowledge Base

## Background

This article takes the management of a robot team's knowledge base as an example. Previously, the robot team used Youdao Cloud Note as a team knowledge accumulation tool.

As a team knowledge base, it was easy to use, but had some obvious drawbacks:

1. The entire team used a shared note account with no internal permission management, allowing anyone to edit or delete other people's articles.
2. The article content was not standardized, with some people using H1 headings throughout, making it difficult to read.
3. There was no version control, so once content was deleted by mistake, it was irretrievable.

## The Significance of a Team Knowledge Base

- **Reduces time, manpower, and marginal costs in knowledge transfer.** Reduces the coupling of knowledge, improves the reuse rate of knowledge, and allows future generations to avoid the pitfalls of their predecessors; forms a networked knowledge structure, achieving the effect of 1+1>2.
- **Avoids the risk of knowledge gaps and losses.** The team has a relatively high turnover rate each year, and knowledge is easily lost due to personnel flow, which is not conducive to inheritance.

## Accumulating Knowledge

After the knowledge base platform is established, it is time to accumulate knowledge, which is a stage that everyone in the organization participates in. Everyone in the organization is a contributor to the knowledge base. However, it is best to establish some brief rules for knowledge accumulation beforehand, such as standardizing the format of knowledge submissions, naming topics, paragraph formats, etc. The knowledge accumulation stage is actually the most difficult stage in knowledge management, and the key difficulty lies in how to cultivate the habit of active knowledge accumulation among members of the organization. Some methods that can be used for reference include:

- Promote and guide team members to use it, so that everyone realizes the importance of knowledge accumulation.
- Provide appropriate training and communication for the use of the knowledge base platform.
- Make the knowledge base platform as easy to use as possible to avoid rejection due to complexity.
- In daily communication, refer to the location of knowledge in the knowledge base, so that everyone develops a dependence on the knowledge base unconsciously.
- Encourage attention. If a person's contributed knowledge receives widespread attention, then that person will have a greater enthusiasm for contributing knowledge. The person in charge of knowledge management within the organization can regularly organize brief summaries of newly added high-quality knowledge and send them to everyone to attract them to read and pay attention to the knowledge; displaying the ranking of knowledge attention can also stimulate everyone's enthusiasm for knowledge sharing.
- Discover and encourage top contributors of knowledge sharing.
- Migrate previous platform content to the standard format and encourage everyone to search for previously accumulated knowledge on the knowledge base.

## Organizing Knowledge

Since the knowledge base is enriched by collaboration among members of the organization, new knowledge submissions are somewhat random and distributed, not systematic, so these knowledge submissions need to be regularly organized by a dedicated person, categorized appropriately, and given more reasonable tags to make them as systematic as possible. This work is very necessary, otherwise, in the long run, the knowledge in the knowledge base will be like individual trees, growing alone, and will never become a forest.

## Current Situation of the Team

After using up 10 GB of storage space, we decided not to continue using the membership and began to search for a suitable team knowledge base. 

At first, I considered using platforms such as Yuque, DingTalk Knowledge Base, Teambition, GitBook, Confluence, etc., but the problems with pricing, permission management, and indescribable network issues could not be avoided. I also imagined using static platforms such as VuePress and Docusaurus, but they lacked online editors and required operations such as submitting PRs on GitHub, which undoubtedly increased the usage threshold for ordinary team members.

My basic requirements for a team knowledge base are:

1. **Permission management:** Different users should have different reading permissions.
2. **Online editing:** Reduce the operation threshold for ordinary users.
3. **Support for MarkDown syntax:** Improve writing efficiency and standardize content format.
4. **Simple UI:** Good-looking design is productive.
5. **Version control:** Facilitates regular backups and can be traced back in case of problems.
6. **Full-text search:** Reduces query complexity.

Coincidentally, the robot team acquired a NAS, so I planned to use it as the server for the knowledge base and build a dynamic knowledge base website using an open-source project. After two months of selection and a week of tinkering, the team knowledge base based on DokuWiki was finally built. For technical details, please see the next article.
