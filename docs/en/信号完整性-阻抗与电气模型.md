# Signal Integrity - Impedance and Electrical Models

Impedance (Electrical Impedance, Z) is a collective term for the resistance, inductance, and capacitance of a circuit to the obstruction of AC current, defined as the ratio of voltage to current (Z = V/I). Impedance is a complex number, with the real part called resistance and the imaginary part called reactance. Capacitance in a circuit is called capacitive reactance, while inductance is called inductive reactance. Capacitive and inductive reactance together are called impedance.

For a constant voltage, the higher the impedance, the smaller the current flowing through it, and vice versa. In extreme cases, the impedance of an open circuit is infinite, while that of a short circuit is zero. In interconnects, impedance is a key factor affecting signals. When a signal propagates, it constantly reacts according to the instantaneous impedance.

## Basic Electrical Models

In establishing the basic electrical model, we imagine the following ideal two-port components:

1. Ideal resistor
2. Ideal capacitor
3. Ideal inductor
4. Ideal transmission line

Among them, the characteristics of ideal resistance, capacitance, and inductance can be concentrated at one point, so they are called lumped circuit elements; while the characteristics of ideal transmission lines are distributed along the line. The goal is to establish an equivalent circuit model that makes its impedance as close as possible to the impedance measured by actual components.

## Impedance of Ideal Resistor in Time Domain

The impedance of an ideal resistor is constant, with a numerical value equal to its resistance, and independent of voltage and current.

## Impedance of Ideal Capacitor in Time Domain

For an ideal capacitor, there is a certain relationship between the charge stored between the two plates and the voltage difference. Its capacitance is defined as follows:

$$
C=\frac{Q}{V}
$$

Where C represents capacitance (unit F), Q represents the charge stored between the plates (unit C, Coulomb), and V represents the voltage between the two plates (unit V).

The impedance of a capacitor is obtained by the voltage across its two terminals and the current flowing through it. In fact, the current does not really flow through the capacitor, but it seems that there is a current flowing when the voltage across the capacitor plates changes.

As shown in the above figure, some positive charges are added to the upper plate, and some negative charges are added to the lower plate, while the positive charges originally present on the lower plate are pushed out, so it seems that there is a current flowing through the capacitor. This current, which is formed by the displacement of bound charges in polarized dielectrics, is called displacement current, and it is not a real current, but only the movement of charges. Its definition is as follows:

$$
I=\frac{dQ}{dt}=C\frac{dV}{dt}
$$

From the above equation, it can be seen that current only flows through the capacitor when the voltage across the capacitor plates changes. If the voltage remains constant, there will be no displacement current.

Therefore, the impedance of an ideal capacitor can be expressed as:

$$
Z=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{V}{C\frac{dV}{dt}}
$$

The impedance of a capacitor is related to the waveform of the voltage across its two terminals. If the voltage changes quickly (large waveform slope), the current flowing through it is large, and the impedance is small; similarly, when the voltage change rate is the same, the larger the capacitance, the smaller the impedance.

## Impedance of Ideal Inductor in Time Domain

For an ideal inductor, the voltage across its two terminals is defined as follows:

$$
V=L\frac{dI}{dt}
$$

Where V represents the voltage across the inductor, L represents the inductance value, and I represents the current flowing through the inductor. It can be seen that the voltage across the inductor is related to the rate of change of the current flowing through it, and the rate of change of the current depends on the voltage difference across the two terminals. Whether the voltage difference across the two terminals or the rate of change of the current is the cause and which is the effect depends on which one is the driving source. The impedance of an inductor can be expressed as the ratio of the voltage across its two terminals to the current flowing through it:

$$
Z=\frac{V}{I}=L\frac{\frac{dI}{dt}}{I}
$$

If the current flowing through the inductor increases rapidly, the impedance becomes very large, and vice versa; and if the current is DC, the impedance is close to 0. Of course, the actual impedance of an inductor is closely related to the specific waveform of the current.

## Impedance in Frequency Domain

As can be seen from the above text, the calculation formulas for the impedance of inductors and capacitors in the time domain are relatively complex functions, but they are much simpler when analyzed in the frequency domain.

In frequency domain analysis, sine waves are the only waveforms that exist, so analysis can only be done by studying their interaction with ideal components. The three characteristics of a sine wave are frequency, amplitude, and phase. Generally, we use radians to describe them, and the relationship between angular frequency (rad/s) and frequency (f) is:

$$
\omega=2\pi f
$$

We apply a sinusoidal voltage to both ends of an ideal component and observe the current flowing through it. The impedance is still defined as the ratio of voltage to current, but now it is the ratio of the sinusoidal voltage and current. Since both the ideal component and the ideal transmission line are linear components, the current displayed is consistent with the frequency of the input voltage.

According to the definition of impedance, the magnitude of impedance can be expressed as:

$$
|Z|=\frac{|V|}{|I|}
$$

At the same time, it is necessary to calculate the phase difference between the two waveforms. In the frequency domain, impedance can be represented as follows: at 10MHz, the impedance magnitude is 20Ω, and the phase is 30° (the voltage leads the current by 30°). These three elements are indispensable because the impedance magnitude and phase are both frequency-dependent and will change with frequency. In addition, impedance in the frequency domain can also be represented by complex numbers, which include phase information in the complex number to simplify calculations.

## Impedance of Ideal Resistors in the Frequency Domain

We continue to analyze the impedance of ideal components in the frequency domain. Since only sinusoidal voltage and current need to be processed in the frequency domain, if a current source is used to apply a sinusoidal current to the resistor, a sinusoidal voltage will be generated across its two ends, which can be expressed as:

$$
V=I_0 sin(\omega t) \cdot R
$$

The sinusoidal voltage is the product of R and the sinusoidal current. According to the above formula, the impedance of an ideal resistor can be expressed as:

$$
Z=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{I_0 sin(\omega t) \cdot R}{I_0 sin(\omega t)}=R
$$

In fact, the impedance of an ideal resistor is its resistance value, which is independent of frequency and has zero phase difference. This result is consistent with the conclusion in the time domain.

## Impedance of Ideal Capacitors in the Frequency Domain

To analyze the impedance of an ideal capacitor in the frequency domain, a sinusoidal voltage needs to be applied to its two ends, so the current flowing through it can be expressed as:

$$
I=C\frac{d V_0sin(\omega t)}{dt}=C\omega V_0 cos(\omega t)
$$

It can be seen that even if the voltage remains unchanged, the current will vary with frequency. The higher the frequency, the greater the amplitude of the current flowing through it. That is to say, the impedance of a capacitor decreases as the frequency increases and can be expressed as:

$$
Z=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{V_0 sin(\omega t)}{C\omega V_0 cos(\omega t)}=\frac{1}{\omega C}\cdot \frac{sin(\omega t)}{cos(\omega t)}
$$

It can be seen that the magnitude of impedance is $\frac{1}{\omega C}$, and as the angular frequency increases, the impedance decreases.

> Since the phase of impedance is the phase difference between the sinusoidal voltage and current, which is a phase difference of $-90°$ between sine and cosine in a capacitor, it is represented by the complex number $-i$. Therefore, the impedance of a capacitor in complex number form is $\frac{-i}{\omega C}$.

For example, if there is an ideal 10nF decoupling capacitor, its impedance at 1kHz is approximately 16kΩ, which is calculated as $\frac{1}{2\pi \cdot 1kHz \cdot 10nF}$. If the frequency drops to 1Hz, the impedance is about 16MΩ.

## Impedance of Ideal Inductors in the Frequency Domain

For an ideal inductor in the frequency domain, we apply a sinusoidal current, and the voltage generated is:

$$
I=L\frac{d I_0sin(\omega t)}{dt}=L\omega I_0 cos(\omega t)
$$

When the current amplitude remains constant, the higher the frequency, the greater the voltage required to maintain the current amplitude. That is to say, the impedance of an inductor increases as the frequency increases and can be expressed by the definition of impedance as:

$$
Z=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{L\omega I_0 cos(\omega t)}{\omega I_0 sin(\omega t)}=\omega L \cdot \frac{cos(\omega t)}{sin(\omega t)}
$$

It can be seen that due to the characteristics of the inductor, the higher the frequency, the more difficult it is for AC current to flow through the inductor.

> Similar to capacitors, for the impedance of inductors, the phase difference is $+90°$, which is represented by the complex number $i$. The complex number representation of the impedance of an inductor is $Z=i\omega L$.

In practical decoupling capacitors, their own shape and packaging will bring about parasitic inductance, which is about $2nH$. If it is regarded as an ideal inductor, then at $1GHz$, it will bring an impedance of $Z=2\pi \cdot 1GHz \cdot 2nH=12Ω$. Because at the same frequency, the impedance of an ideal capacitor is only $0.01Ω$, it can be explained that in high frequency, the practical capacitor behaves inductively.
