# Basic Components - Field Effect Transistor

The field effect transistor (FET) is a device that controls current with voltage. The most commonly used FET is the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistor, which is composed of metal, oxide, and semiconductor materials. This article will focus on the enhancement-type N-channel MOSFET.

The pins of the FET correspond to those of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT): the gate (G) corresponds to the base (b), the drain (D) corresponds to the collector (c), and the source (S) corresponds to the emitter (e). The arrow indicates the direction of electron flow.

In normal operation, there is no current flowing through the gate of the FET. Therefore, the current flowing through the drain is equal to that flowing through the source. The FET works by using the voltage between the gate and source to control the current flowing through the drain, making it a voltage-controlled device.

## Pin Definitions of MOSFET

The MOSFET has three pins (G, S, D) with the following definitions:

- G: gate
- S: source
- D: drain

For an N-channel MOSFET, the power supply is usually connected to the drain and the output is connected to the source. For a P-channel MOSFET, the power supply is usually connected to the source and the output is connected to the drain. The pin connections for enhancement-type and depletion-type MOSFETs are basically the same.

The source and drain of the MOSFET can be interchanged because they are both N-type regions formed in a P-type backgate. In most cases, these two regions are the same and interchanging them does not affect performance.

## Parasitic Diode

Due to the manufacturing process, the MOSFET may have a parasitic diode, also known as a body diode.

When the MOSFET is conducting, the drain and source are conducting, and the body diode is in the off state. This is because the MOSFET has a low on-resistance, which is not enough to turn on the parasitic diode.

## Conducting Conditions of MOSFET

The MOSFET is a voltage-controlled device, and whether it conducts depends on the voltage difference between the gate and source.

For an N-channel MOSFET, it conducts when $V_g-V_s>V_{gs(th)}$.

For a P-channel MOSFET, it conducts when $V_s-V_g>V_{gs(th)}$.

## Characteristics of Enhancement-Type MOSFET

The structure of an enhancement-type MOSFET is two N-type channels formed on a P-type silicon substrate, with aluminum electrodes drawn from them as the source and drain (which can be interchanged), and a thin layer of SiO2 insulation layer covering the surface of the semiconductor. Another aluminum electrode is installed on the insulation layer between the drain and source as the gate, and an electrode is also drawn from the substrate as the backgate. Because the substrate is usually already connected to the source at the factory, the drain and source cannot be interchanged.

The I-V characteristic curve of an enhancement-type MOSFET is shown in the figure above. The left figure is the transfer characteristic, and the right figure is the output characteristic. They share the same y-axis.

The key elements of the I-V characteristic are:

1. **Threshold voltage $U_{GS_(th)}$**: From the figure, we can see that $U_{GS_(th)} = 1 V$. When $U_{GS} < U_{GS_(th)}$, the current $i_D$ is always 0 regardless of the value of $U_{DS}$. The MOSFET only turns on when $U_{GS} > U_{GS_(th)}$.
2. **Equation for the saturation region**: $i_D = K(u_{GS}-U_{GS_(th)})^2$, where K affects the growth rate of the transfer characteristic curve (in units of $A/V^2$).
3. **Boundary between the saturation region and the ohmic region**: As $U_{GS}$ increases, the boundary voltage $U_{DS_{dv}}$ also increases, and it satisfies $U_{DS_{dv}}=U_{GS} - U_{GS_(th)}$.

## Operating States of MOSFET

Unlike the BJT, the MOSFET cannot have its drain and source pins reversed because some models have a parasitic diode in parallel. For an N-channel MOSFET, the current flows from the drain to the source, and for a P-channel MOSFET, the current flows from the source to the drain. The operating state can be determined using the following table:



Several working regions:

- **Cutoff region**: When $U_{GS}$ is less than the threshold voltage $U_{GS_(th)}$, the MOSFET does not conduct.
- **Variable resistance region**: $U_{DS}$ is small, and $I_D$ increases as $U_{DS}$ increases.
- **Constant current region**: $U_{DS}$ changes, and $I_D$ changes very little.
- **Breakdown region**: When $U_{DS}$ reaches a certain value, the MOSFET is broken down, and $I_D$ suddenly increases. If there is no current limiting resistor, it will be burned out.
- **Overloss region**: High power, need to strengthen heat dissipation, pay attention to maximum power.

## Main parameters of MOSFET

DC parameters:

- **Threshold voltage $U_{GS_(th)}$**: A parameter of enhancement-mode MOSFETs. It refers to the minimum value of $\left| u_{GS} \right|$ required to make $i_D > 0$ when $U_{DS}$ is constant.
- **Cutoff voltage $U_{GS_(off)}$**: A parameter of depletion-mode MOSFETs and junction FETs, similar to $U_{GS_(th)}$, representing $u_{GS}$ when $i_D$ is a specified small current and $U_{DS}$ is constant.
- **DC input resistance $U_{GS_(DC)}$**: The ratio of gate-source voltage to gate current. Generally, $U_{GS_(DC)} > 10^9 \Omega$ for MOSFETs.

Key selection parameters:

1. **Breakdown voltage V_BRDSS**
   - Should leave room for temperature changes
2. **On-state resistance R_DS(on)**
   - Positive temperature coefficient, suitable for parallel operation
   - The smaller the on-state resistance, the smaller the conduction loss
   - The smaller the on-state resistance, the larger the Qg, and the slower the corresponding switching speed
   - The greater the switching loss, the more need to consider a trade-off in high-frequency operation
3. **Maximum junction temperature**
   - Can never exceed the maximum junction temperature
   - Can only be calculated through thermal resistance after measuring the case temperature
4. **Dynamic capacitance and Qg**
   - Not a fixed value, depends on operating conditions
   - As a switch, it is hoped to open quickly, requiring a driver chip to provide a large instantaneous current
   - As a soft-start MOSFET, it needs to be slowly turned on to effectively suppress surge current

N-MOS:

- The gate needs a higher voltage drive than the source
- Better performance
- More choices
- Lower cost

P-MOS:

- The gate needs a lower voltage drive than the source
- No need for higher voltage drive, simple drive

## Feedback

Definition: Returning a portion or all of the output signal (voltage/current) of an amplification circuit to the input and superimposing it with the input signal.

Negative feedback: The returned signal weakens the input signal.  
Positive feedback: The returned signal strengthens the input signal.

## Common packages for MOSFETs

### SOT package

SOT (Small Out-Line Transistor) package is generally used for low-power MOSFETs.

SOT-89 package:

### TO package

TO (Transistor Out-line) is an early packaging specification, which was originally mostly in-line packaging (such as TO-92, TO-220, TO-252), and later evolved into surface mount packaging. TO252 and TO263 are typical examples, with TO-252 also known as D-PAK and TO-263 also known as D2PAK.

The MOS tube in D-PAK packaging has three electrodes, and the drain (D) pin is cut off and not used, instead using the backside heat sink as the drain, which can output larger currents while also dissipating heat better.

SOP (Small Out-Line Package) is also known as SO, SOL, or DFP. It usually has SOP-8, SOP-16, SOP-20, SOP-28, etc. (the number represents the number of pins). Most MOS SOP packages use the SOP-8 specification.
