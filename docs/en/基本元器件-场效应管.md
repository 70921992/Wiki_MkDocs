# Basic Components - Field Effect Transistor

A Field Effect Transistor (FET) is a device that allows for **voltage-controlled current**. Among these, the MOSFET, or Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor, is the most commonly used. Below, we'll focus on the discussion of the Enhancement-Mode N-Channel MOSFET.

The pin configuration of a field-effect transistor corresponds to that of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The Gate (G) is equivalent to the Base (b), the Drain (D) corresponds to the Collector (c), and the Source (S) corresponds to the Emitter (e). The arrow indicates the direction of electron flow.

In normal operation, no current flows through the Gate. As a result, the Drain current is always equal to the Source current. The core principle involves controlling the Drain current using the voltage applied between the Gate and Source (GS), which is why it is also known as a voltage-controlled device.

## Pin Configuration of the MOSFET

A MOSFET typically has three pins (G, S, D), defined as follows:

- G: Gate
- S: Source
- D: Drain

For N-Channel devices, the power supply is typically connected to D, and the output is taken from S. For P-Channel devices, the power supply is connected to S, and the output is taken from D. The pin configuration for Enhancement-Mode and Depletion-Mode devices is generally the same.

It's important to note that the Source and Drain pins of the MOSFET can be swapped without significantly affecting performance since both regions are typically N-type within a P-type backgate.

## Parasitic Diodes

Due to manufacturing processes, MOSFETs may have parasitic diodes, often referred to as body diodes.

When the conduction conditions for the MOSFET are met, the Drain (D) and Source (S) of the MOSFET conduct, while the body diode is in cutoff state. Since the MOSFET has very low on-state resistance, the parasitic diode does not usually conduct.

## Conduction Conditions of MOSFET

MOSFETs are voltage-controlled devices, and their conduction is determined by the voltage difference between the Gate (G) and Source (S).

For N-MOSFETs, conduction occurs when $V_g - V_s > V_{gs(th)}$.

For P-MOSFETs, conduction occurs when $V_s - V_g > V_{gs(th)}$.

## Characteristics of Enhancement-Mode MOSFET

Enhancement-Mode MOSFETs are structured on a P-type silicon substrate with two N-type channels. Aluminum leads are used to connect the Source (S) and Drain (D), and a very thin layer of SiO2 insulating material is applied to the surface of the semiconductor. An aluminum electrode is placed on the insulating layer between the Drain and Source, serving as the Gate (G), while an electrode is also connected to the substrate. In most cases, the substrate is already connected to the Source, making it impossible to interchange the Drain and Source.

The voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of an Enhancement-Mode MOSFET are illustrated in the figure. The left side shows the transfer characteristics, while the right side displays the output characteristics. They share the same vertical axis.

Key features of the V-I characteristics:

1. **Threshold Voltage $U_{GS_(th)}$**: From the graph, $U_{GS_(th)} = 1 V$. When $U_{GS} < U_{GS_(th)}$, the current $i_D$ remains at 0, regardless of $U_{DS}$. The MOSFET only starts conducting when $U_{GS} > U_{GS_(th)}$.

2. **Saturation Region Equation**: $i_D = K(u_{GS}-U_{GS_(th))^2$, where K influences the rate of increase in the transfer characteristics (measured in $A/V^2$).

3. **Boundary between Variable Resistance and Saturation Region**: As $U_{GS}$ increases, the boundary voltage $U_{DS_{dv}}$ also increases, and it satisfies $U_{DS_{dv}} = U_{GS} - U_{GS_(th)}.

## MOSFET Operating States

MOSFETs differ from bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) in that some models have internal diodes in parallel, which means that the Drain (D) and Source (S) cannot be reversed. In N-Channel devices, current flows from D to S, and in P-Channel devices, it flows from S to D. The following table can be used to determine the operating state:

Several Operating Regions:

- **Cutoff Region**: When $U_{GS}$ is less than the threshold voltage $U_{GS_(th)}$, the MOSFET does not conduct.
- **Linear Region**: $U_{DS}$ is small, and $I_D$ increases as $U_{DS}$ increases.
- **Saturation Region**: $U_{DS}$ varies, and $I_D$ changes very little.
- **Breakdown Region**: When $U_{DS}$ reaches a certain value, the MOSFET breaks down, and $I_D$ suddenly increases; without current limiting resistors, it can be damaged.
- **Over-Dissipation Region**: Higher power dissipation, requires enhanced heat dissipation, and careful consideration of maximum power.

## Main MOSFET Parameters

Direct Current Parameters:

- **Threshold Voltage $U_{GS_(th)}$**: A parameter for enhancement-type MOSFETs. It denotes the minimum value of $\left| u_{GS} \right|$ required to ensure $i_D > 0$ when $U_{DS}$ remains constant.
- **Off Voltage $U_{GS_(off)}$**: A parameter for depletion-mode MOSFETs and junction field-effect transistors, similar to $U_{GS_(th)}$. It represents $u_{GS}$ when $U_{DS}$ remains constant, and $i_D$ is a specified small current.
- **Direct Current Input Resistance $U_{GS_(DC)}**: The ratio of gate-source voltage to gate current; typically, $U_{GS_(DC)}$ for MOSFETs is greater than $10^9 \Omega$.

Key Selection Parameters:

1. **Breakdown Voltage V_BRDSS**
   - Varies with temperature, should have sufficient margin.
2. **On-Resistance R_DS(on)**
   - On-resistance has a positive temperature coefficient, suitable for parallel operation.
   - Lower on-resistance leads to lower conduction losses.
   - Lower on-resistance results in larger Qg, which leads to slower switching speeds and higher switching losses; this should be balanced, especially under high-frequency operation.
3. **Maximum Junction Temperature**
   - Should never exceed the maximum junction temperature.
   - It can only be determined by measuring the case temperature and calculating through thermal resistance.
4. **Dynamic Capacitance and Qg**
   - Not fixed values; depend on operating conditions.
   - When used as a switch, fast turn-on is desirable, requiring a driver chip to provide instantaneous high current.
   - When used as a soft-start MOSFET, a slow turn-on effectively suppresses surge currents.

N-MOS:

- The gate voltage needs to be higher than the source voltage for driving.
- Offers better performance.
- Provides more options.
- Lower cost.

P-MOS:

- The gate voltage needs to be lower than the source voltage for driving.
- Does not require higher voltage drive, simplifying the driver circuit.

Negative Feedback: The returned signal weakens the input signal.
Positive Feedback: The returned signal enhances the input signal.

## Common MOSFET Packages

### SOT Packages

SOT (Small Out-Line Transistor) packages are generally used for low-power MOSFETs.

### TO Packages

TO (Transistor Out-line) is an older package specification, originally in a through-hole package (e.g., TO-92, TO-220, TO-252), which later evolved into surface-mount packages. TO-252 and TO-263 are typical examples, with TO-252 also known as D-PAK and TO-263 as D2PAK.


**D-PAK Package:**

The MOSFET packaged in a D-PAK format features three electrodes, with the drain terminal (D) having its pin clipped and not in use. Instead, the backside serves as the drain, allowing for higher current output and improved heat dissipation.

**TO-252 Package:**

**TO-263 Package:**

**SOP Package:**

SOP (Small Out-Line Package), also known as SO, SOL, or DFP, typically comes in variations like SOP-8, SOP-16, SOP-20, SOP-28, and so on (with the number indicating the pin count). For MOS devices, SOP packages primarily adhere to SOP-8 specifications.
