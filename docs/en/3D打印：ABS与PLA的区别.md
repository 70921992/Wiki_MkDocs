# 3D Printing: Differences between ABS and PLA

How to choose between ABS and PLA materials for 3D printing?

## ABS Material

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a traditional material used for 3D printing.

### Printing Temperature

When using ABS for printing, the printer nozzle temperature is generally set between 210-240℃, and the bed temperature is above 80℃. Additionally, ABS has a softening temperature of 105℃.

### Printing Performance

ABS prints smoothly but may experience warping and detachment issues due to cooling.

### Strength

ABS has high strength and elasticity, and can bend under pressure without breaking.

### Odor

ABS produces an odor during printing. It is recommended to use a closed printer or maintain good ventilation to avoid inhaling excessive gas.

### Use Cases

ABS is suitable for scenarios that require toughness, high temperatures, and frequent collisions.

The downside is that printers without a heated bed cannot use ABS for printing, as warping and detachment may occur. It is also not recommended to use ABS in poorly ventilated rooms.

## PLA Material

PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a biodegradable plastic, some of which even meet edible grade standards.

### Printing Temperature

When using PLA for printing, the printer nozzle temperature is generally set between 180-200℃, and a heated bed is recommended with a temperature of 60℃. Additionally, PLA has a softening temperature of 60℃.

### Printing Performance

Compared to ABS, PLA is more prone to clogging the nozzle during printing (due to its tendency to adhere and stretch), but does not experience warping and detachment issues.

### Strength

PLA has lower elasticity and strength, but this can be resolved by adjusting the filling and wall thickness during printing.

### Use Cases

PLA is relatively environmentally friendly (as it is biodegradable), inexpensive, and does not produce odors during printing. It is not suitable for high-temperature or collision scenarios, as temperatures above 60℃ and impacts may cause the printed product to deform or break.
