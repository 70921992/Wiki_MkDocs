# 3D Printing: Differences Between ABS and PLA

When it comes to 3D printing, how do you choose between ABS and PLA materials?

## ABS Material

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a more traditional material used in 3D printing.

### Printing Temperature

When printing with ABS, the printer nozzle temperature is generally set between 210-240℃, and the bed temperature is set at 80℃ or higher. Additionally, ABS has a softening temperature of 105℃.

### Printing Performance

ABS prints smoothly, but can experience warping and detachment from the bed due to cooling.

### Strength

ABS is strong and flexible, able to bend under pressure without breaking.

### Odor

ABS produces an odor during printing. It is best to use a closed printer or ensure good ventilation to avoid inhaling too much gas.

### Use Cases

ABS is suitable for scenarios that require toughness and can withstand collisions and higher temperatures.

The downside is that printers without a heated bed cannot use ABS, as it may warp and detach during printing. It is also not recommended to use ABS in poorly ventilated rooms.

## PLA Material

PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a biodegradable plastic, some of which can even meet food-grade standards.

### Printing Temperature

When printing with PLA, the printer nozzle temperature is generally set between 180-200℃, and a heated bed is not necessary but recommended, with a temperature set at 60℃. Additionally, PLA has a softening temperature of 60℃.

### Printing Performance

Compared to ABS, PLA is more prone to clogging the nozzle due to its tendency to adhere and stretch when melted, but it does not experience warping and detachment from the bed.

### Strength

PLA is less elastic and strong than ABS, but this can be addressed by adjusting the infill and wall thickness settings during printing.

### Use Cases

PLA is relatively environmentally friendly (as it is biodegradable), affordable, and does not produce an odor during printing. It is also less prone to warping.

However, PLA is not suitable for high-temperature or collision scenarios. Temperatures above 60℃ and impacts can cause the printed product to deform or break.
