# Four-School Exchange - Planning Proposal - Official

## I. Basic Information

- **Date**: March 27, 2021 (Saturday)
- **Location**: Middle competition venue of B2B3, Guangzhou City Polytechnic (formerly Guangzhou College of South China University of Technology)

## II. Schedule for the Day

### Morning: Adjustment and Debugging

To address the issue of "not being used to the environment" for each participating team, we plan to leave some time for everyone to adjust and debug their own robots after arriving at the competition venue. 
The referee team will test the public venue equipment.

### Noon: Lunch and Rest

At noon, we plan to have lunch at the second cafeteria. To avoid too many people gathering, we will take three batches to have lunch, and the time arrangement for each batch is as follows:

- **First batch**: 11:30
- **Second batch**: 11:50
- **Third batch**: 12:00

After lunch, we plan to rest from 12:30 to 13:30. 
Students who do not want to rest can visit the school and laboratory under the guidance of our staff.

### Afternoon: Official Competition

We plan to start the official competition at 14:30 in the afternoon. Half an hour before the start of the competition, the referee team will check the robots of each participating team and simulate the official competition process.

The competition projects are as follows:

- 3v3 (1 hour): 2:30-3:30
  - Attack and defense (alternating)
  - Red base (sentry)
  - Blue base (outpost)
- 2v2 (30 minutes): 3:30-4:00
- 1v1 (30 minutes): 4:00-4:30
- Fun match (30 minutes): 4:30-5:00
  - Speed race
  - Timed completion of tasks at fixed points

The competition will end at 5 pm in the afternoon. We will hold exchange activities, exchange gifts, and WeChat contacts.

### Evening: Exchange Activities

We tentatively plan to end the competition at 5 pm on the same day. After the competition, each participating team will enter the exchange session. 
We will organize each participating team to engage in friendly and in-depth exchanges, exchange gifts and souvenirs, and take a group photo.

After the exchange activities, we will send each participating team back home on campus, and the exchange will end successfully on the same day.
