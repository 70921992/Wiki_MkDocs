# Power Integrity Design

Power integrity refers to the quality of the power waveform and focuses on the power distribution network (PDN). It considers the overall power supply network of the system to eliminate/reduce the impact of noise on the power supply. The design goal of power integrity is to control power noise within the operating range, provide clean and stable voltage to the chip, maintain it within a small tolerance range (usually within 5%), respond in real-time to rapid changes in load current, and provide a low-impedance return path for other signals.

The main sources of power noise are:

- Output noise of the power supply module (VRM, including LDO/DC-DC)
- DC resistance and parasitic inductance of wiring
- Synchronous switch noise (SSN)
- Power and ground plane resonance noise
- Coupling noise of adjacent power networks
- Coupling noise of other components

When a large transient current flows through the circuit during logic state switching of many chip pins, it causes fluctuations in the ground plane, resulting in inconsistent ground between the chip and the system, known as ground bounce; it also causes differential voltage between the chip and the system power supply, known as power bounce. When designing PCB stack-up, it is recommended to increase the vertical distance between power plane layers as much as possible and reduce the vertical distance between power and ground planes.

## Power Integrity Design Strategies

- Pay attention to the current-carrying capacity of vias, wiring, and power planes; when multiple power supplies are arranged on one plane, the power plane needs to be divided, and the division method should be simple and reasonable, and the size of the division area should meet the current-carrying capacity requirements.
- Try to make the power plane and ground plane appear in pairs and adjacent, and as close as possible.
- Pay attention to the design of decoupling capacitors. The decoupling effect of capacitors has certain distance requirements, that is, the decoupling radius. The fan-out of capacitor pads is recommended to use multiple vias.
- Pay attention to the impact of synchronous switch noise (SSN, ground bounce and power bounce), and increase decoupling capacitors; under the premise of meeting the overall system performance requirements, use smooth drive signals as much as possible (to slow down the rise and fall time of the driver).

## Power Integrity Test Items

### Voltage (Accuracy)

- Test instrument: Multimeter
- Test method: Test separately under no load/full load
- Test points: Power chip output pin, power pin of the chip being used
- Acceptance criteria: Generally within the range of nominal voltage value Â±5% (determined according to the voltage requirements of the chip)

### Power Noise/Ripple

- Definition
  - Ripple: A component that appears between output terminals and synchronizes with input frequency and switching frequency, represented by effective value, generally below 0.5% of output voltage
  - Noise: A high-frequency component other than ripple that appears between output terminals, also represented by peak-to-peak value, generally below 1% of output voltage
  - Ripple and noise: The combination of the two, represented by peak-to-peak value, generally required to be below 2% of output voltage
- Test instrument: Oscilloscope
- Test method
  - Test separately under no load/full load
  - Ripple: Use the ground loop proximity measurement method (proximity measurement) with the oscilloscope bandwidth set to 20MHz and the DC bias voltage (offset) set to the voltage accuracy measurement value above.
  - Ripple and noise: Set the oscilloscope bandwidth to full bandwidth (Full)
- Test points: Both ends of the output capacitor
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Generally, ripple is required to be less than 1% of output voltage (tested at 20MHz bandwidth, the result can be regarded as pure ripple)
  - Generally, ripple and noise are required to be less than 2% of output voltage (tested at full bandwidth, the result can be regarded as ripple + noise)
- Notes
  - When testing, pay attention to the principle of proximity and keep the ground loop as short as possible
  - Use a passive probe for testing
  - Record the frequency of the ripple during testing for analysis

### Voltage Rise and Fall Waveform

- Test instrument: Oscilloscope
- Test method: Set the oscilloscope to trigger on the rising/falling edge, observe the voltage rise and fall waveform of the power chip output pin and the power line on the system, and ensure that the waveform can be fully displayed to identify any issues.
- Test points: Power chip output pin, power line on the system
- Acceptance criteria:
  - The overshoot and undershoot of the power output voltage should generally not exceed 10% of the measured voltage. When testing at the front end of the chip, refer to the general standard for voltage levels.
  - There should not be a significant voltage drop when the power is turned on, and there should not be significant rebound and kickback when the power is turned off (the drop and rebound cannot cross the chip startup working voltage). If there is a step phenomenon, evaluate the impact.
  - If negative voltage occurs, it needs to be discussed based on the actual situation.
  - Pay attention to the timing requirements for the power-up and power-down sequence of the chip.
- Notes: It is necessary to test the power-up and power-down of the system, board insertion and removal, and power board insertion and removal.

### Soft Start Circuit Parameters

- Test Instrument: Oscilloscope
- Test Method: Use multi-channel testing, observe time difference after power on
- Test Points: One circuit before soft start, one circuit after soft start
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Delay Time ($T_{delay}$): Generally required to be within the range of 20 ~ 200ms
  - Rise Time ($T_{rise}$, time for output voltage to rise from 10% to 90%): The smaller the range, the better, but the surge current must also meet the acceptance criteria
  - No multiple oscillation phenomena
- Notes: Need to test for system power on/off, board insertion/removal, and power board insertion/removal scenarios

### Power Current and Surge Current

- Test Instrument: Oscilloscope
- Test Method:
  - Power Current: Use a current probe to observe the waveform of the power-on current and the stable waveform of the current after power-on
  - Surge Current: Same as above. It is best to test the power-on surge current during cold start (when the surge current is the largest); the power-off surge current is best tested when the board is fully loaded
- Test Points: Clamp the current probe on the tested current path
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - The stable value of the power current cannot exceed 90% of the maximum rated output current
  - The surge current value cannot exceed 5 times the rated output current (more than 3 times should be noted)
  - The current under any circumstances must be greater than the minimum load of the power supply and must meet the maximum capacitive load requirements
- Notes:
  - Need to test for system power on/off, board insertion/removal, and power board insertion/removal scenarios
  - To test the surge current, it is necessary to remove inductive components such as inductors, because inductive devices themselves have the effect of suppressing surge current.

### Power Alarm Signal

- Test Method: Create an alarm condition in the system and test the level of the alarm signal
- Test Points: The receiving end of the alarm signal
- Acceptance Criteria: Refer to the specification of the power chip

### Average Current Parameters of Redundant Power Supplies

- Test Method: Use the method of testing the output current of the test power supply to test the output values of each channel of the redundant power supply, and compare the output currents of each channel
- Test Points: Each channel current output link of the redundant power supply
- Acceptance Criteria: The output values of each channel current of the system power supply and its redundant power supply (average current) differ by less than 10%
