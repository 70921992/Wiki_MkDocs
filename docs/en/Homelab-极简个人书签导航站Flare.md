# Homelab - Minimalist Personal Bookmark Navigation Site Flare

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20230410170939.png)

**Flare** is a lightweight, fast, and beautiful personal navigation page with no database dependencies. The application data is completely open and transparent, supporting online editing and built-in Material Design Icons with over 6k icons.

## Deployment (Docker Compose)

First, create the `compose.yaml` file and paste the following content:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
version: "3.6"

services:
  flare:
    container_name: ${STACK_NAME}_app
    image: soulteary/flare:${APP_VERSION}
    # For more startup parameters, please refer to the documentation https://github.com/soulteary/docker-flare/blob/main/docs/advanced-startup.md
    ports:
      - ${APP_PORT}:5005
    volumes:
      - ${STACK_DIR}:/app
    command: flare --nologin=0 # Enable user login mode, you need to set the `nologin` startup parameter to `0` first
    environment:
      - FLARE_USER= ${APP_USER} # If user login mode is enabled and FLARE_USER is not set, the default user is `flare`
      - FLARE_PASS= ${APP_PASS} # If user login mode is enabled and FLARE_USER is not set, the password will be generated by default and displayed in the application startup log
    restart: always
```

(Optional) It is recommended to create a `.env` file in the same directory as `compose.yaml` and customize your environment variables. If you do not want to use environment variables, you can also customize your parameters directly in `compose.yaml` (such as replacing `${STACK_NAME}` with `flare`).

```dotenv title=".env"
STACK_NAME=flare
STACK_DIR=xxx # Custom project storage path, for example ./flare

# flare
APP_VERSION=latest
APP_PORT=xxxx # Custom access port, choose one that is not occupied
APP_USER=xxxx # Custom username
APP_PASS=xxxx # Custom password
```

Finally, execute the `docker compose up -d` command in the same directory as `compose.yaml` to start the orchestrated containers.

## Configuration Instructions

You can modify the addresses of applications and bookmarks in `apps.yml` and `bookmarks.yml` in `${DIR}/flare`. The container will update in real time. You can also add the following parameters to the URL for debugging:

- Boot operation: `/guide`
- Settings page: `/settings`
- Online editing: `/editor`
- Icon acquisition: `/icons`
- Help page: `/help`
