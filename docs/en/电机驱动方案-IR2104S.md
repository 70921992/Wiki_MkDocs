## Basic Parameters

- Input
  - **VM**: Input 12-36V, power supply for the motor, determined by the parameters of XL2009E1, IR2104S, and AP30H80K.
  - **VCC_3V3**: Input 3.3-5V, external input H-bridge system operating voltage, determined by the parameters of logic chip SN74LVC1G08DCKR.
  - **IN1/IN2**: External logic input, high and low level voltage recommended to follow VCC_3V3, truth table see below.
  - **PWM**: PWM input, high and low level voltage is consistent with IN1/IN2 voltage.
  - **SD**: Default internal pull-down, low level effective (turn off the IR2104S half-bridge chip), external input high level (VCC_3V3 voltage) to turn on the IR2104S.
- Output
  - **M+/M-**: Connect to external motor.
  - **VCC_12V**: On-board XL2009E1 circuit voltage regulator output, as a backup power output.

When using the motor drive module, the H-bridge system needs to be grounded with the external controller.

The truth table for the logic control of this solution is as follows:

| SD  | IN1 | IN2 | PWM | Motor Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------- |
| 0   | x   | x   | x   | Coasting    |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | Forward     |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | Reverse     |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | x   | Brake       |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | x   | Brake       |
| 1   | x   | x   | 0   | Brake       |

## Basic Principle

### Logic Circuit

To drive a motor, two pairs of half-bridge circuits are needed to form an H-bridge full-bridge circuit. In order to control the motor state according to the truth table, two AND gate circuits are used here to perform AND operation on the external input PWM signal and IN1/IN2, and the result (PWMA/PWMB) is passed to the IN pin of IR2104. The power input of the logic chip is paralleled with a 100nF capacitor for decoupling.

### Voltage Stabilization Circuit

The voltage stabilization circuit is based on the XL2009E1 Buck chip, which functions to stabilize the external power supply input to 12V and provide power to the IR2104S chip (its power supply range is 10-20V).

The design of the voltage stabilization module can be found in the article [**Power Solution (Buck) - XL2009E1**](https://wiki-power.com/%E7%94%B5%E6%BA%90%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88%EF%BC%88Buck%EF%BC%89-XL2009E1), and will not be elaborated here.

### Half-Bridge Drive Circuit

The basic knowledge of DC brushed motor drive can be found in the article [**Design of DC Brushed Motor Drive**](https://wiki-power.com/%E7%9B%B4%E6%B5%81%E6%9C%89%E5%88%B7%E7%94%B5%E6%9C%BA%E9%A9%B1%E5%8A%A8%E7%9A%84%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1), and will not be elaborated here.

IR2104S is a half-bridge driver chip from Infineon. Its main parameters are as follows:

- Floating bootstrap withstand voltage up to +600V
- Gate drive supply voltage of 10-20V
- Compatible with 3.3V/5V/15V logic input levels
- Other features:
  - Under-voltage lockout
  - Integrated dead-time control
  - Cross-conduction prevention logic
  - In-phase with logic input for upper gate
  - Both upper and lower gates are turned off during shutdown
  - Propagation delay matching for upper and lower gates

Typical application schematic:

In this design, the IR2104S is powered by 12V and connected in parallel with a 100nF input decoupling capacitor. IN is the logic input pin, with input above 3V considered high and below 0.8V considered low. The PWMA/PWMB high/low level signals output by the logic chip can control the opening and closing of the upper and lower gates. SD is the external shutdown input (active low). When IN and SD are mixed input, the timing diagram for the HO/LO gate pin states of the upper and lower gates is as follows:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220407153203.png)

As can be seen, if IN is high, the upper gate is opened with a high gate voltage and the lower gate is closed with a low gate voltage, and vice versa. If SD detects a low level, both upper and lower gates will be pulled low and turned off regardless of the input level of IN.

To prevent shoot-through of the upper and lower gates on the same half-bridge, the IR2104S integrates dead-time control. The timing diagram for dead-time control is as follows:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220407153300.png)

The typical value of DT is 520ns.

Timing diagram for opening/closing conduction delay of upper and lower gates:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220407153941.png)

The typical values of $t_{on}$ and $t_{off}$ are 680ns and 150ns, respectively.

Because N-MOSFETs are used in this design (with the conduction condition of $V_g-V_s>V_{gs(th)}$), a high-side floating bootstrap circuit is needed to properly turn on the upper gate. This design uses a 1uF/50V MLCC capacitor connected between the VM and VB pins to raise the high-level voltage of the HO pin above the $V_{GS(th)}$ of the N-MOSFET, which is the IR2104S supply voltage minus the forward voltage drop of the diode, allowing the upper gate to conduct properly.

When selecting MOSFETs, parameters such as $V_{DSS}$, $V_{gs(th)}$, $I_D$, and $R_{DS(on)}$ need to be considered. $V_{DSS}$ is determined based on the voltage of the driven motor plus sufficient margin, and $I_D$ is added with sufficient margin according to the application requirements. Smaller $R_{DS(on)}$ is better. Taking into account the parameters and price, this design uses AP30H80K.

For the design of the decay mode, since the IR2104S does not integrate synchronous decay, we use the SS34 Schottky diode for asynchronous decay.
