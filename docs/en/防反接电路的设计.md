# Design of Reverse Connection Protection Circuit

Reverse connection protection circuit is quite important in circuit design, because you never know what kind of fancy operation your users might do, leading to board explosion due to reverse connection of power supply. A good reverse connection protection circuit, at the cost of adding a few more components, is responsible for the safety of users/products.

## Diode Reverse Connection Protection Circuit

As shown in the figure, adding a diode (unidirectional conductivity) on the positive/negative path of the power supply achieves reverse connection protection. This circuit is simple and has the lowest cost. The disadvantage is that the voltage drop is large (about 0.6V); the larger the current, the more severe the heating; when the reverse voltage is too large, there will be leakage current, so a margin should be left. Schottky diodes with relatively high cost but lower voltage drop can be selected.

;Taking the above figure as an example. When the power is just turned on, the parasitic diode of the MOS tube conducts, the voltage of the S level is VCC-0.6V, the G level is 0V, and the P-MOS conducts; when the power is reversed, the G level is high, does not conduct, and protects the subsequent stage.
;
;In practical applications, a resistor can be added between the P-MOS gate and source. This method also has a distinction between P-MOS and N-MOS, both of which use the parasitic diode and conductivity of the MOS tube, but the conduction resistance of N-MOS is smaller than that of P-MOS, so it will reduce a little power consumption. After the power is reversed, the MOS tube is disconnected, which can protect the subsequent circuit well. This method is widely used, and N-MOS is recommended for actual use.

## MOSFET Reverse Connection Protection

MOSFET has a lower on-resistance ($R_{DS(on)}$) and can be used as a reverse connection protection circuit with only a small power loss. Because N-MOS conducts at a high level of G, and P-MOS conducts at a low level of G, N-MOS is generally used for reverse connection protection on the low-end side, and P-MOS is used for the high-end side:

When the power is correctly connected, the MOS tube conducts, and the subsequent circuit can receive power normally; when the power is reversed, the MOS tube is cut off to protect the subsequent circuit.

The loss of MOSFET reverse connection protection is $R_{DS(on) * I_{load}}$. The selection criteria for MOSFET are to minimize $R_{DS(on)}$ and $U_GS{th}$ below the power supply voltage. Compared with P-MOS, N-MOS has a smaller on-resistance and a richer selection.

## Rectifier Bridge Reverse Connection Protection Circuit

The bridge rectifier circuit has two diodes that generate voltage drop, and the power consumption and heating are relatively large. Unless for some special occasions, it is generally not recommended.

## Fuse + Regulator Diode

This circuit design is very clever, it can prevent reverse connection and overvoltage. Its principle is:

When the power supply Vin is reversed, the regulator diode D1 conducts forward, and the negative voltage of the load is the conduction voltage Vf of the diode, which is generally low and will not burn out the subsequent load circuit. At the same time, the voltage mainly falls on F1, so the current will quickly rise until it exceeds the fuse current of F1, the fuse will blow, and the power supply will be disconnected, so D1 will not be burned out due to excessive current.

When the voltage is correct but too high (for example, greater than 5.6V of the regulator diode), because the regulator diode D1 exists, the voltage obtained by the load end is about 5.6V. There will be a relatively large voltage (Vin-5.6V) on F1, and the current will rise until it blows, protecting the subsequent circuit. This is overvoltage protection.

Several points to note for this circuit:

1. Selection of fuses. The rated current of the fuse should be greater than the normal working current of the load (the fuse should not blow when the circuit is operating normally).
2. Selection of voltage regulators. The voltage regulator value should be greater than the normal Vin power input (the voltage regulator should not break down when the power input is normal), but should be less than the maximum input voltage allowed by the subsequent stage (the voltage regulator value should not burn out the subsequent circuit).
3. The condition of "maximum allowable current of the voltage regulator + load current at power-on > breakdown current of the fuse" should be met. Only when the fuse is blown before the power supply overvoltage input, the voltage regulator will not burn out due to excessive current passing through.
4. The negative voltage Vf generated by the reverse connection circuit is generally less than 1.5V. The back-end circuit should be able to withstand a negative voltage of 1.5V and not be burned out.
5. This circuit should be used as much as possible in circuits with a power of less than 500mW.
