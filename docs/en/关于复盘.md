# On Reviewing

After a game of chess, both sides repeat and review the outcome of the game.

# Redefining

Whether encountering problems or completing smoothly, reviewing can increase experience and provide support for future processes, as well as improve efficiency.

In daily life, it is like gaining wisdom from a setback. The pitfalls encountered should be recorded and summarized in a timely manner, so that the future path can be smoother. It is like the graph of an exponential growth function.

During the review, when a familiar situation appears before you, you can often judge how to respond based on experience and choose a relatively reasonable path among multiple options.
