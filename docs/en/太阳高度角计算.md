# Calculation of Solar Altitude Angle

To represent the position of the sun in the sky, a coordinate system needs to be selected first. There are usually two coordinate systems used, one is the equatorial coordinate system and the other is the horizontal coordinate system.

Concepts:

- Latitude $\varphi$: -90°~90°, with north latitude as positive.

## Equatorial Coordinate System

The equatorial coordinate system takes the equatorial plane as the basic plane and defines the position of the sun using two quantities, **declination angle** and **hour angle**.

- **Declination angle $\delta$**: the angle between the line connecting the Earth and the Sun and the equatorial plane.
- **Hour angle $\omega$**: negative in the morning and positive in the afternoon, numerically equal to the time (in hours) from noon multiplied by 15°.

The declination angle varies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn (-23.45°~23.45°) as the Earth revolves around the Sun:

The formula for calculating the **declination angle $\delta$** is as follows:

$$
\delta =23.45sin[360×(284+n)/365]
$$

where n is the day number in the year (1~365).

## Horizontal Coordinate System

The horizontal coordinate system takes the observer's horizontal plane as the basic plane. In the horizontal coordinate system, we use **altitude angle** and **azimuth angle** to define the position of the sun in the sky at a certain time.

Note: This diagram requires some geometric imagination, i.e., the circle is on the paper and the sun is above the paper.

- **Altitude angle $\alpha_s$**: the angle between the line of sight from the observer to the sun and the projection of this line on the ground.
- **Azimuth angle $\gamma_s$**: the angle between the projection of the line of sight from the observer to the sun on the ground and the direction of due south. Due south is 0°, westward is positive, and eastward is negative.

The formula for calculating the **altitude angle $\alpha_s$** is:

$$
sin \alpha_s =sin \varphi sin \delta+cos \varphi cos\delta cos \omega
$$

The formula for calculating the **azimuth angle $\gamma_s$** is:

$$
sin \gamma_s=\frac{cos \delta sin \omega}{cos \alpha}
$$

$$
cos \gamma_s=\frac{sin \alpha sin \varphi - sin \alpha}{cos \alpha cos \varphi}
$$

## Legal Time and True Solar Time

Legal time refers to administrative time (such as Beijing time), while true solar time is based on noon at 12 o'clock.

For example, the highest solar altitude angle in Beijing and Urumqi is at true solar time 12 o'clock. However, under legal time, the highest solar altitude angle in Urumqi (i.e., noon) is around 14 o'clock.
