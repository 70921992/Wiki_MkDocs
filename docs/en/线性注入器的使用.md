# Usage of Linear Injector

Linear injector can directly superimpose AC ripple and DC voltage of power supply as input to measure its PSRR. This article will explain using PICOTEST's J2120A as an example.

Linear injector is similar to broadband injection transformer, but broadband injection transformer cannot be used to measure the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of LDO because it is intolerant to DC current. Even very small DC current (5mA or less) can significantly reduce signal capacity and even saturate the transformer completely. Therefore, linear injector is needed for measurement.

Basic parameters of J2120A linear injector:

- Maximum DC input voltage: 50VDC
- Maximum continuous current: 5A
- Maximum voltage drop: 3.25VDC
- 3dB frequency response: 15Hz~5MHz
- Available frequency response: 10Hz~10MHz
- Recommended injection signal: -20~10dBm
- Operating temperature range: 0~50℃

It should be noted that input decoupling capacitor cannot be added during testing because the output of J2120A has a certain impedance, and adding a capacitor will form a low-pass network, affecting the PSRR result.

Parameters setting of network analyzer:

- Start frequency: 10Hz
- Stop frequency: 10MHz
- Sweep mode: logarithmic
- Sweep points: ≥401
- Output level: -10dBm
- 1/2 channel attenuation: 10dB
- Receiver bandwidth: 100Hz
