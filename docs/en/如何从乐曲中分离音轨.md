# How to Separate Audio Tracks from Music

French music streaming company Deezer has open-sourced a track separation software called Spleeter, which can separate vocals and various instrument sounds from music by simply entering a command. It supports common audio formats such as mp3, wav, and ogg.

Spleeter also supports GPU acceleration. If run on a GPU, it can separate tracks 100 times faster than real-time, meaning that it only takes 3 seconds to separate a 5-minute song.

Spleeter has received 2.4K stars on GitHub and over 1000 upvotes on Hacker News within just one week of its launch.
