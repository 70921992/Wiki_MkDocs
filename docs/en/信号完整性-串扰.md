# Signal Integrity - Crosstalk ðŸš§

When a signal passes through a signal line, it will induce related signals on adjacent signal lines on the PCB board, which we call crosstalk. Crosstalk is usually manifested as glitches. Crosstalk is caused by the coupling of parasitic inductance between transmission lines, which can cause signal distortion.

Crosstalk is divided into near-end crosstalk (NEXT) and far-end crosstalk (FEXT).

As shown in the figure, a transition signal is transmitted from the top signal line. In the pink area, the two wires are very close together (not in compliance with the 3W principle), so crosstalk will occur. The wire below is the disturbed wire.

When the transition signal enters the interference area (pink area), crosstalk begins to occur:

It can be observed that **as the interference source moves and emits simultaneously in two directions**, the interference waveform in the same direction as the signal will superimpose with time, while the waveform in the opposite direction to the signal remains unchanged.

When the transition signal is transmitted out of the interference area, the raised waveform on the disturbed line begins to disappear and moves in their respective directions:

Finally, the interference received at the near-end/far-end is as follows:

Methods to reduce crosstalk:

- Increase the spacing between routing lines: 3W principle
- Reduce the distance between signal lines and ground lines
- Reduce the coupling length of parallel routing lines
- Increase the rise or fall time of the signal: this can reduce the impact of high-frequency signals under the condition of meeting timing requirements
- Reasonably use end matching technology: weaken or even consume the reflection of the signal, thereby reducing the intensity of crosstalk.
