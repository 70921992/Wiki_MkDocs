# The Concept of Middle Platform

## What is Middle Platform

My understanding: similar to the object-oriented programming concept, and also similar to **containerization**. It unifies the **basic resources configuration** (black box encapsulation) and provides APIs for easy access.

> Big middle platform, small front-end.

A powerful middle platform can provide strong resources for various small front-ends, enabling rapid development on top of basic support.

## Division of Middle Platform

Everything can be middle-platformed. The specific divisions of middle platform include:

- **Business Middle Platform**: sinking the common business of each project
- **Technical Middle Platform**: avoiding reinventing the wheel, providing underlying frameworks, engines, middleware, etc.
- **Data Middle Platform**: conducting various data collection and analysis for each project
- **Algorithm Middle Platform**: providing algorithm capabilities for each project, such as recommendation algorithms, search algorithms, image recognition, speech recognition, etc.

## Applicable Scenarios

- **From 0 to 1 stage**: there is no need to build a middle platform. The primary task is to quickly build the product, prove its market value, and survive.
- **From 1 to N stage**: suitable for building a middle platform. At this stage, the product has been recognized by the market. The primary task is not to survive, but to thrive. While the project complexity is not high, it is possible to consider sinking the common parts of each project, forming a middle platform for easy experimentation of new projects and iteration of old projects in the future.
- **From N to N+1 stage**: necessary. It is better to suffer short-term pain for long-term development needs. Early middle platforming is still needed to avoid more difficult maintenance in the future.
