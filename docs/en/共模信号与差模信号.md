# Common Mode Signal and Differential Mode Signal

Differential mode signal, also known as common mode signal, refers to the signal difference between two lines, while common mode signal, also known as ground signal, refers to the signal of two lines respectively to ground.

- Differential mode signal: signals of equal magnitude but opposite direction.
- Common mode signal: signals of equal magnitude and same direction.

For a two-input system, common mode is the arithmetic mean of the two input ends, and differential mode is the difference between the two input ends.

For a pair of signal lines A and B, differential mode interference is equivalent to adding an interference voltage between A and B, while common mode interference is equivalent to adding an interference voltage between A and ground, and between B and ground respectively. The use of twisted pair to transmit differential signals that we usually see is to eliminate common mode noise. The principle is simple: the two lines are twisted together, and the common mode interference voltage received is very close, so the value of Ua - Ub remains unchanged. In practical applications, temperature changes and various environmental noises can be regarded as common mode interference. However, if the ground noise reduction of the two lines is not the same during transmission, resulting in a voltage difference between the two lines, the common mode noise will be transformed into differential mode noise.
