# How to Efficiently Create Presentations

## Background

When preparing for a speech, our usual process is:

1. Create a PowerPoint presentation
2. Copy the .ppt file to the computer for the speech using a USB drive
3. Begin the speech

There are several problems with this process:

1. Creating the presentation is complex and requires us to focus on style rather than content
2. Different versions of PowerPoint may not be compatible with the presentation for the speech
3. Copying files using a USB drive is not elegant and may spread viruses

If there was a new process that allowed you to create a PowerPoint presentation like an outline, without worrying about style, and present it by simply opening a website, wouldn't that be attractive?

## Creating Presentations with Reveal.js

Reveal.js is a framework for creating HTML-based presentations. When creating a presentation, you are essentially creating a webpage.  
You can download the entire repository [**hakimel/reveal.js**](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) and edit the `index.html` file directly. Then, drag the `index.html` file into your browser to play the presentation.

We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server plugin for real-time preview:

The syntax for Reveal.js can be found in the [**official documentation**](https://revealjs.com/).

## Online Presentations

We can host our presentations on GitHub Pages for online presentations.

The specific steps are to synchronize the entire project folder to GitHub and enable the Pages feature (you can also bind your own domain name). Then, you can directly access the website to present your PowerPoint presentation online.

If the computer used for the presentation does not have an internet connection, you can still copy the entire project folder and play the presentation directly in the browser on the presentation computer.

You can visit <https://slides.wiki-power.com/> to see the online presentations I have created.
