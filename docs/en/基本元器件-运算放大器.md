As the saying goes, operational amplifier (op-amp) is the ultimate goal of analog electronics. An operational amplifier is a device that can amplify electrical signals (voltage/current/power). Moreover, it can also function as a buffer, filter, and perform various operations such as integration, differentiation, multiplication, and logarithm.

An op-amp has a pair of differential input terminals (in-phase $u_+$ and out-of-phase $u_-$ voltage inputs), a single-ended output terminal $u_o$, and a pair of power supply pins $V_+$ and $V_-$ (usually not shown). It performs comparison operations internally based on the in-phase $u_+$ and out-of-phase $u_-$ voltages, and amplifies the output through the output terminal $u_o$. The output impedance of $u_o$ is 0, and the current flowing out is provided by the positive power supply terminal $V_+$, while the current flowing in is provided by the negative power supply terminal $V_-$.

When the operational amplifier operates in the **linear region**, it satisfies the relationship:

$$
u_o=A_{uo}(u_+-u_-)
$$

where $A_{uo}$ is the operational amplifier's **open-loop voltage gain** (u represents voltage, o represents open), which is generally infinite.

## Operational Amplifier Operating States

The voltage transfer characteristics of an integrated op-amp are shown in the following figure:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20210819134709.png)

The figure is divided into linear and nonlinear regions:

- Operating in the linear amplification region: the slope of the diagonal line is the open-loop voltage gain.
- Operating in the nonlinear region: i.e., saturation state, represented by the horizontal lines at the left and right ends of the figure, with an output voltage of $-U_{om}$ (the voltage of the negative power supply terminal $V_-$) or $+U_{om}$ (equivalent to the voltage of the positive power supply terminal $V_+$).

## Operational Amplifier Power Supply

The power supply of an operational amplifier is generally divided into **single power supply** or **dual power supply**. Under a single power supply, $V_+$ is connected to a positive voltage, and $V_-$ is connected to ground. Dual power supply generally refers to $V_+$ being connected to a positive voltage, and $V_-$ being connected to a negative voltage. Different power supply methods bring different frequency performance and input/output ranges.

In addition, the op-amp can operate in an asymmetric positive/negative power supply ($V_+$/$V_-$) situation (such as $V_+$ being 5V and $V_-$ being -3V), and it does not need to know the position of the ground, but can still function normally.

Rail-to-rail of an op-amp refers to the output voltage being able to reach the power supply voltage. For example, if it is a non-rail-to-rail op-amp, if the power supply is 0~5V, the output may only be able to reach 0.7~4.3V, while a rail-to-rail output can reach 0~5V.

## Op-Amp Virtual Short and Virtual Open

### Virtual Short

Virtual short is viewed from the perspective of voltage. **Under negative feedback conditions, the voltages of the positive and negative input terminals are basically equal, approximating a short circuit (but not a true short circuit), which is called a virtual short.**

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606211723.png)

Referring to the negative feedback circuit, it can be seen that if the voltage of the in-phase input terminal is slightly higher than that of the out-of-phase input terminal, the negative feedback circuit will raise the voltage of the out-of-phase input terminal until it is equivalent to the voltage of the in-phase input terminal; conversely, if the voltage of the in-phase input terminal is slightly lower than that of the out-of-phase input terminal, the voltage of the out-of-phase input terminal will also follow the voltage of the in-phase input terminal.

### Virtual Open

Virtual open is viewed from the perspective of current. **The input impedance of the op-amp's two input terminals is very high, and the current flowing in is only in the microampere range, approximating no current flowing in, which is called a virtual open.**

Note: The input impedance of the op-amp's two input terminals is very high, which is true for general situations. There are also exceptions, such as current feedback op-amps.

## Common Op-Amp Circuits

Because the open-loop voltage gain of an op-amp is infinite, special circuit structures are needed to achieve appropriate amplification effects.

### Voltage Follower

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606221550.png)

A voltage follower (also known as a buffer) is used for buffering between a high-impedance signal source and a low-impedance load.

### Inverting Amplifier

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606221659.png)

The output and input of an inverting amplifier are out-of-phase, and it can amplify the signal out-of-phase.

Effect: By adjusting the resistance values of $R_G$ and $R_F$, $V_{OUT}$ is directly proportional to $V_{IN}$.

Principle:

1. Due to virtual short, $V_- = V_{IN}$.
2. Due to open circuit, the input current at the $V_-$ terminal can be ignored, so $I_{R_G}=I_{R_F}$. According to Ohm's law, $\frac{0–V_-}{R_G}=\frac{V_- - V_{OUT}}{R_F}$, and $V_{OUT}=V_{IN}(\frac{R_F}{R_G}+1)$ is obtained.

### Inverting Amplifier

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606221844.png)

The output of the inverting amplifier is inverted with respect to the input, which amplifies the signal and outputs it in reverse.

### Voltage Subtractor / Differential Amplifier

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606222121.png)

The voltage subtractor / differential amplifier can amplify the difference between two voltages and suppress common-mode voltage.

### Voltage Adder

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606222430.png)

The voltage adder is used to sum multiple voltages.

### Low Pass Filter / Integrator

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606222539.png)

The low pass filter / integrator is used for low pass filtering of signals, limiting signal bandwidth.

### High Pass Filter / Differentiator

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606222649.png)

The high pass filter / differentiator is used to isolate DC signals and amplify AC signals.

### Differential Amplifier

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606222820.png)

The differential amplifier is used to drive differential input ADCs from differential or single-ended signal sources.

### Instrumentation Amplifier

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220606223014.png)

The instrumentation amplifier is used to amplify low-level differential signals and suppress common-mode signals. Here, $V_{IN}$ is the voltage difference between the two input terminals.

## Parameters of Operational Amplifiers

### Open Loop Voltage Gain

The open loop voltage gain $A_{uo}$ represents the amplification factor of the operational amplifier in the linear amplification region, expressed in dB.

### Offset / Bias Voltage

Offset voltage $V_{OS}$ (Input Offset Voltage) is sometimes referred to as input bias voltage. It refers to the situation where the input of the operational amplifier is 0V, and the ideal output of the operational amplifier should be zero, but the actual output of the operational amplifier is not zero. The equivalent input voltage obtained by dividing the actual output voltage by the gain is called offset voltage. Offset voltage actually reflects the symmetry inside the operational amplifier.

The factors affecting offset voltage include temperature (corresponding to temperature drift of offset voltage) and power supply fluctuation (corresponding to power supply rejection ratio). Offset voltage is a DC bias and will be superimposed on the output. If the output is an AC signal, only consider whether the superimposed signal will exceed the supply voltage and cause signal distortion.

We know that the amplification formula of the inverting amplifier is $V_{OUT}=V_{IN}(\frac{R_F}{R_G}+1)$. If we consider the influence of offset voltage, the output is $V_{OUT}=(V_{IN}+V_{OS})(\frac{R_F}{R_G}+1)$.

### Offset Voltage Temperature Drift

Offset voltage temperature drift $T_C V_{OS}$ represents the ratio of the change in input offset voltage to the change in temperature (within the chip's operating temperature range).

Offset voltage temperature drift can cause changes in offset voltage, affecting the operational amplifier output.

### Input Offset Current

Input offset current $I_{OS}$ refers to the difference between the DC current flowing into / out of the two input terminals when the operational amplifier output is zero. Input offset current is affected by manufacturing process.

$$
I_{OS}=I_{B+}+I_{B-}
$$

Bias current $I_B$ refers to the average DC current flowing into/out of the two input terminals when the operational amplifier output is zero.

$$
I_B=\frac{I_{B+}+I_{B-}}{2}
$$

Bias current is influenced by the manufacturing process. The input bias current for bipolar technology is between 10nA and 1μA, while for field-effect transistor technology, it is generally less than 1nA.

Errors can be eliminated by adding matching resistors to the inverting input.

### Gain-Bandwidth Product

The gain-bandwidth product $GBW$ (Gain-Bandwidth Product, GBWP/GBW/GBP/GB) is the product of the open-loop voltage gain and the measurement frequency (bandwidth) at a certain frequency (usually the operational amplifier gain attenuation -3dB).

$$
GBW=A_{uo}*BW
$$

The gain-bandwidth product is influenced by the frequency response characteristics of the operational amplifier's internal capacitance. If the high-frequency signal gain is found to be limited during design, an operational amplifier with a larger GBP parameter must be selected.

### Common Mode Rejection Ratio

The common mode rejection ratio $CMRR$ (Common Mode Rejection Ratio, CMRR) is the ratio of the common mode voltage range (CMVR) to the change in input offset voltage ($\Delta V_{O_{OS}}$) within this range, expressed in dB.

$$
CMRR=20log(\frac{CMVR}{V_{O_{OS}}})
$$

The common mode rejection ratio is influenced by circuit symmetry (offset current and other parameters) and the linear operating range. This parameter is used to indicate the ability of a differential amplifier circuit to suppress common mode signals and amplify differential mode signals. A high common mode rejection ratio means that interference signals from common mode inputs can be more effectively suppressed, improving the signal-to-noise ratio.

### Slew Rate

The slew rate $SR$ (Slew Rate, SR) is also known as the rate of change of voltage. It represents the maximum rate of change of the output voltage under large signal conditions.

$$
SR=2 \pi f V_{pk}
$$

Here, $f$ is the maximum frequency (usually the bandwidth), and $V_{pk}$ is the maximum peak-to-peak value of the amplified output signal.

The slew rate is used to evaluate the operational amplifier's ability to adapt to signal changes and is a parameter that measures the operational amplifier's working speed when large amplitude signals are applied. The output voltage changes linearly only when the absolute value of the input signal change slope is less than SR.

### Other Parameters

- Common mode voltage range $CMVR$: also known as the input voltage range. If the input voltage at both input terminals exceeds this range, the output will experience clipping or excessive nonlinearity.
- Full power bandwidth: the maximum frequency measured under unit gain, at which a sine wave can be obtained with a rated output voltage, and the slew rate will not cause signal distortion.
- Working power supply voltage range: the range of power supply voltage that can be applied when the operational amplifier is working normally.
- Power supply rejection ratio $PSRR$: the ratio of the change in power supply voltage to the change in input offset voltage, expressed in dB.
- Settling time: the time required for the amplifier to reach a predetermined accuracy level or output voltage percentage after applying a step input.
- Power supply current: the current required by the power supply when the amplifier is operating without load.

## Selecting an Operational Amplifier Based on Parameters

The following steps can be taken to select an operational amplifier based on its parameters:

1. Determine the input signal type: for DC signals, attention should be paid to offset current and offset voltage; for differential inputs, it is necessary to determine whether to choose an instrumentation amplifier; for high-frequency AC signals, attention should be paid to the gain-bandwidth product $GBW$ and slew rate $SR$.
2. Determine the accuracy requirements: consider the impact of offset voltage, bias current, offset current, and common mode rejection ratio on accuracy, and determine whether to choose a high-impedance or precision operational amplifier.
3. Determine the environmental conditions: pay attention to the operational amplifier's temperature range, temperature drift, and the impact of power supply ripple rejection ratio $PSRR$.
4. Determine other requirements: number of channels, single/dual power supply (rail-to-rail signal distortion is small, and full-scale output is possible), power size (high voltage/large current).

### Selecting an Operational Amplifier Based on Application

Operational amplifiers can be roughly divided into the following categories based on their applications:

- General-purpose operational amplifiers: for devices with low requirements, with a focus on versatility and cost-effectiveness.
- Audio operational amplifiers: ultra-low noise (high fidelity) and low power consumption (long battery life).
- High-speed operational amplifiers ($GBW ≥ 50 MHz$): low power consumption and low noise SNR.
- Power operational amplifiers: high voltage and large current.
- Precision operational amplifiers ($V_{os} < 1mV$): low offset voltage or low temperature drift, low noise, low power consumption, and wide bandwidth.
