## Types of Base Liquor

Base liquor is the main alcohol used in cocktail mixing. There are generally six types of base liquor: **vodka**, **whiskey**, **rum**, **gin**, **brandy**, and **tequila**.

### Vodka

Vodka is made by distilling and purifying ethanol from water. It is usually distilled three times to achieve a purer taste. During the distillation process, potatoes, syrup, rye, or wheat may be added, as well as some seasoning. The alcohol content of vodka is usually between 35% and 50%, with traditional vodka being 40%. Generally speaking, vodka is a versatile liquor that can be mixed with anything to create different flavors.

### Whiskey

Whiskey is a type of spirit, and is spelled "whisky" in Scotland and Canada, and "whiskey" in the United States and Ireland. It is generally divided into several types:

- Scotch Whisky: produced in Scotland, traditional methods involve adding coal ash during the production process.
- Bourbon Whiskey: made using corn syrup (sweet), its production method is similar to making sourdough bread, adding some alcohol-free beer during fermentation.
- Irish Whiskey: produced in Ireland, it is said to have been made using distillation techniques passed down from monasteries to the public.

### Rum

Rum is made by fermenting and distilling by-products of sugarcane (such as sugarcane juice or molasses). The distillate is a clear liquid, and traditional methods involve aging it in oak barrels.

Rum originated from the ancient method of refining sugarcane, which involved heating sugarcane juice to evaporate the water and crystallize the sugar. Eventually, some high-molecular-weight residue that could not be further heated (carbonized) was made into caramel. However, later New England colonists discovered that it could be used to make liquor, and rum was born. Currently, in order to meet modern tastes, the production of rum has added a storage aging period, making it softer and smoother, with a caramel flavor.

An interesting piece of trivia is that rum has a deep connection with the British Royal Navy and pirates during the Age of Discovery; during the Triangular Trade, it was also used as currency.

### Gin

Gin, also known as juniper berry liquor, is mainly flavored with juniper berries. Gin originated in the Netherlands, where it was originally used as medicine rather than a casual drink. It is a neutral spirit made from grains (with various herbs and spices, mainly juniper berries, added).

### Brandy

Brandy is a type of foreign liquor, made by distilling wine. One liter of brandy usually requires eight liters of concentrated wine. The common classifications are VS (three years or more), VSOP (four years or more), Napoleon (six years or more), XO (ten years or more), and Extra (fifteen years or more).

Of course, good liquor is best enjoyed straight, and using it for cocktails is a bit of a waste.

### Tequila

Tequila is the "soul of Mexico," a strong liquor made from the agave plant. It originated from the indigenous civilizations of Central America, who fermented the polysaccharides and juicy agave into liquor. Later, Spanish colonizers used distillation to increase the alcohol content, gradually replacing the fermentation method.
