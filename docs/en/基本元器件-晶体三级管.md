# Basic Components - Transistors

Transistors are components that control current with current.

## Polarization

Apart from the base, the one with an arrow is the emitter, and the one without is the collector. The arrow pointing outwards represents NPN, and the one pointing inwards represents PNP.

## Basic Current Relationship

The direction of the transistor current depends on the direction of the emitter current.

- NPN: The emitter current flows out, so both the base and collector flow in.
- PNP: The emitter current flows in, so both the base and collector flow out.

Rules:

1. Satisfies Kirchhoff's current law $i_B + i_C = i_E$
2. In the amplification state, the collector current is only controlled by the base current ($i_C = \beta i_B$), and is independent of the voltage between the collector and emitter.
3. When the base and emitter are conducting, the voltage drop $U_{BE}$ is approximately 0.7V.

Therefore, the transistor is a controlled current source, which controls a large current $i_C$ with a small current $i_B$, depending on the constant amplification factor $\beta$ of the transistor.

Therefore, $i_E=(1+\beta)i_B = \frac{1+\beta}{\beta}Â·i_C$

## Output Characteristics

As shown in the figure, the output characteristics of the transistor can be divided into the following regions:

- **Amplification Region**: In this region, the collector current $i_C$ of the transistor hardly changes with $u_{CE}$, and approximately satisfies $i_C = \beta i_B$.
- **Saturation Region**: In this region, the collector current $i_C$ of the transistor increases with the increase of $u_{CE}$. It is generally considered that when $u_{CE}$ is less than the saturation voltage drop $U_{CES}$ (generally 0.3 V), the transistor operates in the saturation region.
- **Cut-off Region**: This is the curve where $I_B = 0$. However, $i_C$ is not zero at this time, because there is a leakage current related to $u_{CE}$. The cut-off region represents the state where the transistor is almost completely closed with almost no current flowing in or out.

If we want to describe the characteristics with mathematical formulas, we need to simplify the curve:

After simplification, we can say:

- **Amplification Region**: Satisfies $i_C = \beta i_B$, independent of $u_{CE}$.
- **Saturation Region**: $i_C$ increases linearly with the increase of $u_{CE}$.
- **$U_{CES}$ Vertical Line**: The boundary between the saturation region and the amplification region.

## Working State of Transistors

- **Cutoff state**
  - Refers to the state where no significant current flows through the base ($I_{BQ}$ is very small, resulting in $I_{CQ}$ also being very small), and the collector and emitter are effectively open circuit.
  - $I_{BQ} = 0, I_{CQ} = 0, I_{EQ} = I_{BQ}+I_{CQ}=0$. The emitter junction is biased to zero or reverse, and the collector junction is reverse biased.
- **Amplification state**
  - Refers to the state where the transistor is at an appropriate $I_{BQ}$ and satisfies $I_{CQ} = \beta I_{BQ},I_{EQ} = (1+ \beta)I_{BQ}, I_{BQ} = \frac{V_{CC}-U_{BE}}{R_B}$
  - The emitter junction is forward biased and the collector junction is reverse biased.
  - This is the most commonly used state in analog circuits.
- **Saturation state**
  - $I_{CQ} < \beta I_{BQ}$, but still varies with $U_{CEQ}$. Both $I_{BQ}$ and $I_{CQ}$ are large, and $I_{CQ}$ is no longer completely controlled by $I_{BQ}$, and the voltage occupied by $U_{CEQ}$ is very small.
  - As long as $U_{CEQ} < U_{CES}$, it enters the saturation state. At this time, increasing $I_{BQ}$ will hardly increase $I_{CQ}$.
  - The emitter junction is forward biased and the collector junction is also forward biased.
  - In analog circuits, it is advisable to avoid entering the saturation state, while in digital circuits, it is expected to enter the saturation or cutoff state.
- **Inverted state**
  - The collector and emitter are reversed. Although it can still be used, it can cause a serious decrease in $\beta$.
  - The saturation state is like turning on a faucet, but there is no water in the tank, so it is like getting as much water as there is.
  - The emitter junction is reverse biased and the collector junction is forward biased.

There are three methods to determine the working state of a transistor, namely estimation method, function solving method, and graphical method. The core of the estimation method is to assume that $U_{BEQ}$ is approximately equal to 0.7 V, but there is an error (the voltage is larger, the error is smaller); the function solving method requires knowledge of the mathematical expressions of the input and output volt-ampere characteristics, and solves the equations, which is generally not used; the core of the graphical method is to use the volt-ampere characteristic curve and the intersection of another line to determine the position of the static operating point, and then visually estimate the result.

## Main parameters of the transistor

- **Current amplification factor $\beta$**: generally 10-100 times, but 30-80 times is suitable for application (too small amplification is not obvious, too large instability).
- **Maximum collector current $I_{CM}$**: exceeding this value may cause damage.
- **Maximum collector power dissipation $P_{CM}$**
- **Collector-emitter breakdown voltage $V_{CEO}$**

## Estimation method

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20210601113429.png)

The `estimation of the static operating point` is to roughly estimate the static state (currents in each branch, potentials at each node) of the transistor circuit using a simple method, assuming that $U_{BEQ}$ is approximately equal to 0.7 V (generally, $I_{CQ}$ and $U_{CEQ}$ are calculated), and the specific steps are as follows:

1. Calculate $I_{BQ}$ based on $U_{BEQ} = 0.7 V$.
2. Assume that the transistor is in the amplification state, that is, $I_{CQ} = \beta I_{BQ}$, and solve for $U_{CEQ}$.
3. If $U_{CEQ} >= 0.3 V$ at this time, the assumption is valid, and the transistor is in the amplification state, and $I_{CQ}$ and $U_{CEQ}$ are the desired values.
4. If $U_{CEQ} < 0.3 V$, the assumption is invalid, and the transistor is in the saturation state.

## Graphical method

The core of the graphical method is to use the volt-ampere characteristic curve and the intersection of another line to determine the position of the static operating point, and then visually estimate the result.

## Basic amplification circuit

In the circuit shown above, the functions of each part are:

- $C_1$/$C_2$: block DC and pass AC. Eliminate the influence of $U_{CC}$. The value is generally a few microfarads to tens of microfarads.
- $U_{CC}$: provide appropriate static operating point for the circuit function.
- $R_B$: provide appropriate $I_B$, with a value generally ranging from tens of ohms to hundreds of kilohms.
- $R_C$: with a value ranging from several kilohms to tens of kilohms.

Analysis:

- Total base-emitter voltage $U_{BE} = U_{BEQ}+u_i$
- Total base current $i_B=I_{BQ}+i_b$
- Total collector current $i_C=I_{CQ}+i_c$
- Total collector-emitter voltage $u_{CE}=V_{CC}-{i_C}{R_C}=V_{CC}-(I_{CQ}+i_c)R=U_{CEQ}+({-i_C}{R_C})$

The drawback of this circuit is that although it has a simple structure, the static operating point is unstable and is greatly affected by the various components.
