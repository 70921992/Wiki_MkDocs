# Guide to Selecting Lithium Batteries

When selecting lithium batteries, the following factors are generally considered:

## Voltage

The voltage of a lithium battery is represented by `number of cells in series + s`. The rated voltage of a single lithium battery is 3.7V, 4.2V when fully charged, and 3.5V when discharged. Therefore, the voltage relationship of lithium batteries with different numbers of cells is as follows:

| Number of Cells | Rated Voltage (V) | Voltage Range (V) |
| :-------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: |
|       2s        |       7.4        |     7.0 – 8.4      |
|       3s        |      11.1        |    10.5 – 12.6     |
|       4s        |      14.8        |    14.0 – 16.8     |
|       5s        |      18.5        |    17.5 – 21.0     |
|       6s        |      22.2        |    21.0 – 25.2     |

## Capacity

The capacity of a lithium battery represents how much electrical energy it can store. For example, 2000mAh represents discharging at a current of 2000mA for one hour.

## Discharge Rate

The discharge rate of a lithium battery is used to indicate the ratio of the charging and discharging currents (`maximum discharge current = C * capacity`). For example, for a battery with a capacity of 1000mAh, if the discharge rate is 1C, the discharge current is 1000mA; if it is 10C, the discharge current is 10000mA.

Choosing a sufficient discharge rate is important. In the moment when the motor of a robot system starts or changes direction, or when a transient response of the system is desired under PID control, a large instantaneous output current may be required. If the current cannot be provided, the voltage may be lowered, causing voltage fluctuations in the control part or even causing the microcontroller to restart.

How to calculate the maximum current of the system? Generally, the power-hungry components such as the motor are given priority. Since the motor is an inductive load, the current at startup can reach 4-7 times the rated current. Therefore, in the design, it is assumed that when the motor starts, **the current is 7 times the rated current**.

After the overall calculation, leave a margin of 20%.
