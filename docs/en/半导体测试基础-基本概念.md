# Semiconductor Testing Basics - Basic Concepts

As chip integration increases, manual testing is no longer sufficient, so automated test equipment (ATE) is used. Because chips are becoming increasingly complex, ordinary bench tests cannot meet the demand. ATE can detect the integrity of integrated circuit functions and is the final process in integrated circuit production to ensure product quality. Chip testing is the last component of the upstream of the semiconductor industry chain. The devices tested are mainly divided into several categories: memory, digital circuits, analog circuits, and mixed-signal circuits.

ATE has many subsystems, including high and low level drive circuits, programmable current loads, voltage comparators for detecting output voltage, PMU connection circuits, high-speed current comparators, and high-speed switches.

From the above figure, the testing system mainly consists of three parts: input, output, and dynamic load:

- **Input section**: Provides VIL/VIH voltage to DUT.
- **Output section**: Compares the output voltage of DUT with VOL/VOH.
- **Dynamic load**
  - By loading IOL/IOH current, the output voltage is obtained and compared with VOL/VOH.
  - Directly compare the output current with ILow/IHigh (generally only available on high-end machines).

The most basic testing is to measure DC and AC parameters. The method used for DC parameters can be Static, using the PE card driver and PMU, and then Force V Measure I or Force I Measure V; or it can use the Functional method, using Current Load and Voltage Comparator, and then run Pattern to test.

## Signal Input and Output

How signals are generated and input to DUT:

### Input Signal Format

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220806184824.png)

- **RZ (Return to Zero)**: In a cycle, binary data is transmitted using a data pulse, and after the data pulse ends, it needs to maintain a low level. This encoding can transmit clock and data signals at the same time, but because a part of the bandwidth is occupied by zero, the transmission efficiency is relatively low. The position of the rising and falling edges can be controlled by Edge Timing.
- **RO (Return to One)**: The opposite of RZ, it needs to maintain a high level. The position of the rising and falling edges can be controlled by Edge Timing.
- **NRZ (Non Return to Zero)**: The difference between NRZ and RZ is that it does not need to return to zero, so one cycle can be used to transmit data, with a bandwidth utilization rate of 100%. If transmitting low-speed asynchronous data, the clock line can be omitted, but the communication baud rate (such as UART) needs to be agreed upon; if transmitting high-speed synchronous data, a clock line needs to be provided separately. NRZ is not controlled by Edge Timing.
- **DNRZ (Delayed Non Return to Zero)**: Delayed non-return-to-zero code is an NRZ waveform with time delay added. The delay time is controlled by Edge Timing.
- **SBC (Surrounded By Complement)**: Complement surround is equivalent to the superposition of RZ and RO. It can have up to 3 edges per cycle, flip the data at T0, show the preset value after a certain delay, maintain it for a certain time, and then flip back. SBC is mostly used to establish/maintain signal control.
- **ZD (Impedance Drive)**: Impedance drive is used to control pin opening or closing (high impedance state).

Clock signals are usually in RZ/RO format, with rising edge effective signals (such as chip select CS or read READ) often using RZ format; and falling edge effective signals (such as output enable OE) often using RO format. Data signals with setup and hold time requirements often use SBC format, while other input signals can use NRZ or DNRZ format.

### Output Signal Formats

#### High/Low Level Output

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220806200604.png)

When outputting high/low logic levels on pins, the high level must be at least higher than VOH, and the low level must be at least lower than VOL.

#### High Impedance Output

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220806201343.png)

The DUT pin is pulled to a voltage between VOL and VOH by an external load and cannot output voltage or current.

#### Load Current Output

Some DUT pins can output load current. If the test system has a programmable current load, it can be tested directly, otherwise an external resistor may be required for testing. Load current output needs to output the specified IOL/IOH current while meeting VOL/VOH standards.

### CP Test and FT Test

CP (Chip Probe) test is a performance and functional test of chips on their pins using a probe while the chip is still in the wafer stage. FT (Final Test) is the final test of the chip after it has been packaged.

### Hot Switching

Hot switching, also known as current-carrying switching, refers to the switching of relays when current is flowing (there can be voltage, and the voltage on both sides should be consistent). This may shorten the life of the relay or damage it, and programming is needed to avoid such situations.

### Latch-up

When a pin is subjected to excessive voltage, a large current may occur in the CMOS device, causing local circuits to be damaged or even burned out.

### Stuck-At Fault

Stuck-at fault (SAF) refers to a signal pin that is fixed in a 0/1/Z level state due to manufacturing defects, resulting in a fault.

### Binning

Binning is the process of grouping DUTs based on test results. For example:

![](https://wiki-media-1253965369.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/img/20220728223700.png)

Hard binning refers to using machines such as handlers to classify into two piles; soft binning refers to recording and distinguishing defective products in software rather than physically classifying them.

The binning process requires at least two bins to distinguish whether a test result passes or fails.

### Program Flow

The design of the program flow is crucial for the entire test. For example, some DC tests require preprocessing (setting specific device logic, such as functional testing), and omitting preprocessing will render subsequent steps meaningless.

The design of the program flow needs to consider many factors: the size of the test volume, which parameters need to be tested, and how to wait for binning. Flowcharts are usually used to present the program flow to ensure that the test flow meets the requirements.
