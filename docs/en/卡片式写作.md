# Card-based Writing

Traditional outline-based writing often leads to "writer's block," with the most typical example being the struggle the night before a paper is due.

> All attention is focused on the urgent matter at hand, becoming narrow and limited, making it easy to overlook global information and not see the big picture.

Card-based writing, like function encapsulation in programming, emphasizes bottom-up encapsulation, layer by layer abstraction, and can be called directly when needed. This not only facilitates reuse (not reinventing the wheel), but also produces new sparks when cards collide.

## Method

**Long-term Collection**: Record ideas seen and thought of in daily life, and produce a separate card for each topic.  
Tools: Notable notes + Nut Cloud synchronization.

**Stage Sharing**: Select the cards recorded in each stage, do not make secondary modifications, and integrate and publish them as a public account article "Fragment Selection: Issue n."  
Tools: Public account platform

**Project Writing**: When writing articles on fixed topics, relevant cards can be integrated and reworked into text. Or randomly combine cards to produce new sparks of thought.  
Tools: Personal website
