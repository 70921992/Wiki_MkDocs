# How to Design the Minimum System for a Microcontroller

This article will focus on the STM32 microcontroller (F1 series).

## Background

When learning embedded systems, we usually start with microcontrollers. To learn microcontrollers, we cannot only focus on software, but must also keep up with hardware knowledge. The combination of software and hardware design is what makes a truly excellent design.

When it comes to hardware design for microcontrollers, we first condense it into the minimum system, which is the most simplified design that can achieve the most basic functions. Using the STM32 (F1 series) microcontroller as an example, the minimum system consists of the following parts: **power supply, reset, clock, startup mode, and download debugging**.

## Power Supply

The STM32 has the following types of power supply:

### Main Power Supply (VDD / VSS)

The main power supply refers to the pins marked as VDD1, VDD2, etc.  
Each pin must have a 100nF filtering capacitor, placed as close to the pin as possible. In addition, a 10uF tantalum capacitor is needed for common use.

### Backup Power Supply (VBAT)

The VBAT pin can be used for battery power. If not used, it can be connected to VDD. VBAT also requires a 100nF capacitor for filtering.  
Refer to the following power selection circuit:

### ADC Power Supply (VDDA / VSSA)

To improve conversion accuracy, the ADC device can draw power from here. Generally, VDDA is connected to VDD through an inductor.

If ADC is not used, VDD, VDDA, and VREF+ (if any) can be connected together, and a 1uF tantalum capacitor + 10nF ceramic capacitor can be used for filtering.

## Reset

Because the STM32 has internal pull-up resistors, only an external 100nF capacitor + button is needed:

When powered on, the CPU is in reset state, and the capacitor is charged. The NRST pin voltage is continuously pulled low. When the capacitor is fully charged, the NRST voltage becomes high, and the CPU exits reset mode and enters normal operation. When the button is pressed, the capacitor is shorted to discharge, and when the button is released, it is recharged to trigger a reset.

According to the official design guide, a 100nF capacitor is sufficient to ensure that the NRST low level duration meets the minimum pulse width requirement for CPU reset and can trigger a reset normally.

If manual reset function is not needed, the button can be omitted.

## Clock

As shown in the above figure, the STM32 clock is divided into the following types:

1. **HSI**: High-speed internal clock, an internal RC oscillator with a frequency of 8MHz.
2. **HSE**: High-speed external clock, can be connected to a quartz/ceramic resonator or an external clock source, with a frequency range of 4MHz to 16MHz.
3. **LSI**: Low-speed internal clock, an RC oscillator with a frequency of 40kHz. The clock source for the independent watchdog can only be this, and it can also be used as the clock source for RTC.
4. **LSE**: Low-speed external clock, connected to a 32.768kHz quartz crystal. LSE is the clock source for RTC.
5. **PLL**: Phase-locked loop frequency multiplication output, with a clock input source that can be selected as HSI/2, HSE, or HSE/2. The multiplication factor can be 2 to 16 times, but the output frequency cannot exceed 72MHz.

From the perspective of stability, we generally use an external crystal oscillator as the clock source when designing. **Usually, an 8MHz crystal oscillator is selected as HSE** for easy multiplication (usually up to 72MHz); **a 32.768kHz crystal oscillator is selected as LSE** for RTC use and easy division (32768 is 2 to the power of 15, which can obtain accurate time).

As for the selection of crystal oscillators, active ones have high precision and passive ones have low cost, and passive ones are generally sufficient.  
If a passive crystal oscillator is selected, a starting capacitor should be added at both ends to filter out high-frequency noise in the crystal oscillator waveform. The capacitance can be selected from 10 to 40pF.

A 1M resistor can be added between the crystal oscillator input and output pins to produce negative feedback, ensuring that the amplifier works in the high-gain linear region. It also acts as a current limiter to prevent the inverter from driving the crystal oscillator overload and damaging it.

## Boot Mode Configuration

**BOOT0 pin is generally pulled down** (connected in series with a 10K resistor and then grounded), and **BOOT1 can be any value**.

If mode switching is required, the following design can also be referred to:

For more information on boot modes, see [**STM32 Boot Modes**](https://wiki-power.com/en/STM32的启动模式).

## Download and Debug Interface

Generally, we use the SWD interface (with fewer wires and convenient), **directly lead out SWDIO, SWCLK, VCC, GND**.  
There is no need to add external pull-up/down resistors because STM32 has already integrated them internally.
