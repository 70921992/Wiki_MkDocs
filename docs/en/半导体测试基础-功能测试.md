# Semiconductor Testing Basics - Functional Testing

Functional Testing mainly verifies the logical functions of a device. It is a type of testing that uses test vectors and test commands. Compared to pure DC testing, the combination steps are relatively complex and highly coupled.

During the functional testing phase, the testing system inputs test vectors into the DUT on a periodic basis, provides predicted results, and compares them with the output data. If the actual results do not match the predicted values of the test vectors, the test fails.

## Basic Concepts

### Test Vectors

Test vectors, also known as test patterns, can be understood as the input-output truth table of the device's designed logical function. Test vectors emphasize timing and are generally a combination of input and output sequences. 0/1 is generally used to represent low/high input levels, L/H/Z is used to represent low/high/hi-Z output levels, and X is used to represent no input or output.

## Functional Testing Methods for Various Parameters

### OS Testing - Functional Testing Method

Short circuits are not considered a function, but they can also be tested using functional testing methods. Turn off the PMU and driver, and use current load and voltage receiver for testing. The test schematic is as follows:

The test process is as follows:

1. Ground all pins except the pin being tested (power and signal pins).
2. Define VOL/VOH (e.g. 0.2V/1.5V).
3. Set the pin being tested to output mode and turn off the pin (hi-Z).
4. Provide VREF (3V) to form a dynamic load current (about 400µA) and detect the voltage on the pin.
   - Higher than VOH (+1.5V): Fail (Open)
   - Lower than VOL (+0.2V): Fail (Short)
   - Hi-Z (voltage drop of about 0.65V after forward bias): Pass
5. Reset the pin state and test the next pin.

The test vector mode for this test is as follows:

```
00000   /* cycle 1 Ground all pins */
Z0000   /* cycle 2 Test the protection diode of pin 1 */
0Z000   /* cycle 3 Test the protection diode of pin 2 */
00Z00   /* cycle 4 Test the protection diode of pin 3 */
000Z0   /* cycle 5 Test the protection diode of pin 4 */
0000Z   /* cycle 6 Test the protection diode of pin 5 */
/* The next cycle will be executed separately */
ZZZZZ   /* cycle 7 Turn off all pins and test them */
```

The schematic diagram of the normal pin voltage change and sampling is as follows. The sampling window is set at 0.9µs with a duration of 0.01µs to allow the voltage to rise to a stable level before sampling:

Next, test the protection diode to ground. Only test whether it is open (if there is a short circuit, it will definitely fail the previous test). The schematic diagram of the functional testing method for the protection diode to ground is as follows:

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220803012747.png)

For this test, only the 7th cycle (ZZZZZ) of the previous test needs to be run once to test all protection diodes to ground in parallel.

(DPS is used to pull down the pin and ground. If it fails open, the measured voltage is VREF instead of the clamp voltage. Do not confuse it with the DC method.)

### VOL/IOL & VOL/IOH Testing - Functional Testing Method

The test schematic is as follows:

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220805151754.png)

The test process is as follows:

1. Supply VDDmin (??).
2. Set VREF (mid-range value), which will generate dynamic load current.
3. Perform functional testing and monitor the voltage of the pins.
   - Below VOH Spec or above VOL Spec: Fail
   - Above VOL Spec: Fail
   - Other ranges: Pass

### VIL/VIH Test - Functional Test Method

VIL/VIH is to see if the DUT can recognize the input logic correctly. The schematic diagram for measuring VIL/VIH using the functional test method is as follows (assuming that the left side of the chip is the input pin and the right side is the output, and the input and output logic levels are in phase):

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220803202212.png)

The process of measuring VIL/VIH using the functional test method is as follows:

1. First, supply the DUT with VDDmax power.
2. Provide the input pin voltage according to the VIL/VIH nominal value, and let other parameters have a certain margin.
3. Perform functional testing and monitor the output pin voltage.
   - Below VOH Spec: Fail
   - Above VOL Spec: Fail
   - Other ranges: Pass
4. Supply the DUT with VDDmin power and repeat the above process.

If the test fails and the error cannot be located, you can first provide more margin to eliminate problems caused by other factors. For example, provide the optimal low level (0V) for VIL and the optimal high level (VDD) for VIH to see if the test can pass according to the process, and then gradually assign the original values of VIH/VIL to eliminate the problem.

### IOZL/IOZH Test - Functional Test Method

The schematic diagram for testing IOZL/IOZH using the functional test method is as follows:

![](https://img.wiki-power.com/d/wiki-media/img/20220805153515.png)

The test process is as follows:

1. Supply VDD to the DUT and set the comparator value to VOL/VOH.
2. Set VREF to generate dynamic load current and measure the pin voltage.
   - Above VOH Spec: Fail
   - Below VOL Spec: Fail
   - Other ranges: Pass
