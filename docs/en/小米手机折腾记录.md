# Xiaomi Phone Hacking Record

Recently, I bought a cost-effective phone, Redmi Note 12 Turbo, and returned to the Android camp. Here, I record the process of hacking.

## Flashing the European version of MIUI

The reason for giving up the Chinese version of MIUI is that from MIUI 13, there are rumors that the system-level anti-fraud is built-in, and I do not want my phone to become a monitoring tool. Moreover, in the Chinese version of ROM, many system apps come with Niupixian ads. Even if they are turned off, they will be added back in the next system update. In comparison, the foreign version of ROM will relatively comply with Android specifications and have no ads, making the system relatively clean.

Before hacking Xiaomi phones, you need to unlock the bootloader (commonly known as unlocking the BL lock). Generally, you need to insert a SIM card and log in to your Xiaomi account, wait for 7 days (the period for no reason to return), and download the [**Xiaomi Unlock Tool**](https://www.miui.com/unlock/index.html) to unlock.

For convenience and continuous OTA updates on the phone, I chose to flash the official version of the EEA (European Economic Area) ROM. You can find the official download link for the ROM corresponding to your model on [**XiaomiROM.com**](https://xiaomirom.com/). If you don't want the built-in unremovable Google family bucket in the system, you can try the EU (folk version) of the European version, which can be found on [**SourceForge**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xiaomi-eu-multilang-miui-roms/files/xiaomi.eu/).

Flashing is generally done by the line flashing method (that is, connecting the data cable to the computer and using the flashing tool to flash the ROM to the phone). First, you need to download the [**MiFlash line flashing tool**](https://miuiver.com/miflash/) from Xiaomi. It should be noted that MiFlash only supports Xiaomi official ROM firmware.

For the specific steps of line flashing, please refer to [**Xiaomi Phone Line Flashing Guide**](https://miuiver.com/how-to-flash-xiaomi-phone/). If you encounter error messages during the flashing process, please refer to [**Xiaomi Line Flash Error Message and Solution**](https://miuiver.com/miflash-problem-list/). Before flashing, remember to back up first, refer to [**Xiaomi Phone Data Backup and Restore Method**](https://miuiver.com/mi-phone-data-backup/); when flashing, try to use the original data cable, connect to the USB2.0 interface of the computer, and do not use Chinese characters in the ROM path.

## Use Magisk to get root access

Magisk is a powerful Android low-level customization tool that can be used to obtain root access and authorize various functional modules. It also has the function of hiding its own root status to prevent some apps from prompting that the system is not safe.

The specific tutorial for installing Magisk can be found in [**Xiaomi Phone Installation Mask Tutorial (Xiaomi Phone Root Access)**](https://magiskcn.com/).

After flashing Magisk and obtaining root access, the following gameplay can be tried:
