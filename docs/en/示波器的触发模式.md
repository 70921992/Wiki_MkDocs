# Trigger Modes of Oscilloscope

The trigger of an oscilloscope refers to the action of capturing a waveform only when a preset condition is met. This action of capturing a waveform based on a condition is called triggering.

If no trigger is set, the signal captured by the oscilloscope may look like this:

The purpose of triggering is to allow the oscilloscope to display a periodic signal stably:

## Three Trigger Modes

### Auto Mode

In auto mode, the oscilloscope first triggers according to the trigger condition. When there is no trigger condition for a set period of time, the oscilloscope will force a trigger and display the signal.

When we do not understand the characteristics of a signal, we can use this mode to ensure that the oscilloscope displays a waveform even when other trigger settings are incorrect. Although the waveform may not be stable, it can provide us with intuitive judgment for further adjusting the oscilloscope.

### Normal Mode

In normal mode, the oscilloscope only generates a scan when the trigger condition is met (so the trigger mode and level must be set first). If there is no trigger signal, no scan will be performed, and no waveform will be visible on the screen.

The purpose of normal mode is to observe the details of the waveform, especially for more complex signals. When we set a specific trigger condition for a specific signal, especially when the time interval that satisfies the trigger condition is relatively long, we can use normal mode.

### Single Trigger

Single trigger is a subset of normal mode. It also generates a scan only when the trigger condition is met, otherwise no scan will be performed. The difference is that once the scan is completed, even if there are subsequent signals that meet the trigger condition, no further scans will be performed, and the scan must be manually restarted by pressing a button.

Single trigger mode is commonly used to capture signals that appear only once or multiple times but do not have periodicity, such as a power-on signal generated by a circuit that appears only once. Without using single trigger, it is difficult to capture this signal.

## Trigger Types

### Slope

The slope trigger option is divided into **rising edge**, **falling edge**, and **rising and falling edge**.

- **Rising Edge**: Set the signal to trigger on the rising edge.
- **Falling Edge**: Set the signal to trigger on the falling edge.
- **Rising and Falling Edge**: Set the signal to trigger on the rising or falling edge.

### Coupling

For signals with high noise, the presence of noise interferes with accurate triggering. The purpose of coupling triggering is to suppress interference and noise in the triggering circuit.

Coupling trigger options are divided into **DC**, **AC**, **high-frequency suppression**, **low-frequency suppression**, and **noise suppression**.

- **DC**: The triggering source signal's AC and DC components are both sent to the triggering circuit.
- **AC**: The DC component of the triggering source signal is filtered out. Suitable for observing signals from low to high frequencies.
- **High-Frequency Suppression**: Signals above a specific frequency in the triggering source signal are filtered out. Suitable for observing signals with high-frequency interference.
- **Low-Frequency Suppression**: Signals below a specific frequency in the triggering source signal are filtered out. Suitable for observing signals with low-frequency interference.
- **Noise Suppression**: Use low-sensitivity DC coupling to suppress noise components in the triggering source signal. Suitable for observing signals with high-frequency noise interference.
