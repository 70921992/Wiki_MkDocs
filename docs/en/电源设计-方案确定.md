### Visual Differences between Linear and Switching Regulators

If the output voltage is compared to the water flow from a faucet, linear regulators require the faucet to be opened wider to increase the water flow, while for switching regulators, the faucet can only be in two states, on or off, so it must switch quickly to control the water flow by changing the duty cycle.

Linear regulators use a three-terminal transistor in a linear state to control the load with constant current and obtain stable voltage output. This method has a simple structure and high noise suppression (up to 60dB, or more than 1000 times), but generally has low efficiency and requires a certain voltage difference between the input and output to stabilize the voltage. It can only perform step-down conversion. Linear regulator circuits are simple, have small ripple, and have high input-side spurious suppression ratio (PSRR), but excess energy is converted into heat to limit the output voltage.

Switching voltage regulation utilizes the characteristics of inductive and capacitive components to store energy and transmit it in segmented packages. These packaged energies are either stored in the magnetic field of the inductor or in the electric field of the capacitor. Switch control ensures that only the energy required by the load is transmitted in each segment, resulting in relatively high efficiency. The advantage of switching voltage regulation is that it can step down, step up, or invert the voltage, and the input voltage range can be wide, with efficiency reaching over 95% in some cases. The disadvantage is that the peripheral circuit is relatively complex, the selection of peripheral components is sensitive, and high-frequency switching signals can cause significant interference and ripple on the voltage output.

### Combination of Switching and Linear Voltage Regulation

Based on the advantages and disadvantages of switching and linear voltage regulators, if they are used in combination (i.e. switching voltage regulation followed by linear voltage regulation), the output voltage ripple can be reduced while efficiency is improved.

### Selection Based on Input and Output Voltage

- $V_{in}>V_{out}$
  - Small voltage difference, low load current, low noise requirements —— LDO
  - Large voltage difference, high load current, not particularly sensitive to noise —— Buck switch
  - Low load current, not sensitive to noise, high efficiency required —— Charge pump
- $V_{in}<V_{out}$
  - Low power —— Charge pump
  - Large voltage difference, high load current, not particularly sensitive to noise —— Boost switch
- $V_{in}$ has a large range of variation, which may be greater than or less than $V_{out}$
  - Low power —— Charge pump
  - High load current, not particularly sensitive to noise —— Buck-Boost switch
- If isolation is required
  - Choose isolated topologies such as flyback, forward, push-pull, full bridge, etc.

## Component Selection

Factors to consider when selecting components:

- **Functionality**: whether it meets the input/output voltage and current requirements
- **Performance**: as low ripple and noise as possible, as high conversion efficiency as possible
- **Price**: overall system cost
- **Supply channel**: ease of purchase

Tools provided by power chip manufacturers can be used to assist in component selection, such as [**TI reference designs**](http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/reference-designs/index.html).

## PCB Layout and Wiring

For LDOs, heat dissipation is an important factor affecting performance and stability, so heat dissipation should be considered when laying out the PCB.  
For DC-DC converters, the path of large currents should be considered to avoid generating large ripples and interfering with feedback pins. The layout provided in the datasheet can generally be used as a reference, such as:
