# Classification of Memory

Memory can generally be classified into four major categories: internal memory (RAM), external memory (ROM), cache memory (Cache), and flash memory (Flash).

## RAM

RAM (random access memory) is a random access memory, and the contents of storage units can be randomly accessed or stored as needed (without linear storage). Accessing data is relatively fast, but data is lost when power is lost, and the capacity is relatively small. Generally, when the CPU (MCU) is running, the program is copied from ROM to RAM for execution, so RAM is generally used as the internal memory that directly exchanges data with the CPU (MCU), also known as main memory or internal memory.

The following are the categories of RAM:

- SRAM: Static RAM, which has static access function. It can save the data stored internally without the need for a refresh circuit. Its characteristics are high performance, low integration (large footprint), high power consumption, and very fast speed, but it is expensive and has a small capacity. Generally, a small piece of SRAM is built into the MCU or SOC for high-speed caching (Cache). Cache is a buffer for data exchange. When a device needs to read data, it first looks in the cache. If it is found, it runs directly. If it is not found, it goes to the memory. Because the read and write speed of the cache is much faster than that of the memory, the significance of the cache is to help the system run faster.
  - PSRAM: Pseudo-static RAM, which has a built-in refresh mechanism.
  - SSRAM: Synchronous Static RAM, which has a clock line and reads and writes based on the clock signal.
- DRAM: Dynamic RAM, which refreshes and charges DRAM at a fixed interval, otherwise the internal data will disappear. The DDR memory used in computers now belongs to DRAM.
  - DARAM: Dual-port RAM, which can be accessed twice in one clock cycle.
  - SDRAM: Synchronous Dynamic RAM, and data transmission is based on the clock signal.
    - SDR SDRAM: Single-Data-Rate SDRAM, which uses a single-ended clock signal and samples on the rising edge of the clock.
    - DDR SDRAM: Double-Data-Rate SDRAM, which samples on the rising and falling edges of the clock, and the operating frequency is twice that of SDR. It uses a differential clock signal to enhance anti-interference. The operating voltage is 2.5V/2.6V.
    - DDR2 SDRAM: The memory clock is 200~533MHz, and the operating voltage is 1.8V.
    - DDR3 SDRAM: 8-bit prefetch mechanism, memory clock is 400~1066MHz, operating voltage is 1.5V/1.35.
    - DDR4 SDRAM: 16-bit prefetch mechanism, operating voltage is 1.2V.
    - DDR5 SDRAM: Operating voltage is 1.1V.
    - GDDR SDRAM: Graphics DDR, currently available in GDDR2~6.
    - LPDDR SDRAM: Low-power DDR, clock is 166MHz, and the operating voltage of LPDDR2 is 1.2V, with a clock of 100~533MHz.

## External ROM

External ROM (Read Only Memory), also known as auxiliary storage, cannot directly exchange information with the CPU. Its storage speed is relatively slow but its capacity is relatively large. In simple systems, it is often used in conjunction with memory as a space for storing programs and other files.

ROM was originally a one-time programmable memory that could only be written once. Subsequently, it could only be read, and the data would not be lost when power was lost. Examples include CD-ROM and DVD-ROM. Later, PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM were developed, which could be conditionally written.

The following are the categories of external memory (in chronological order):

- PROM: Programmable ROM, which uses a matrix of fuses that can be programmed once. If a mistake is made during programming, the chip must be replaced.
- EPROM: Erasable Programmable ROM, which can be erased by ultraviolet light and requires a programmer to generate high-voltage pulse signals during programming.
- OTP-ROM: One-Time Programmable ROM, which is written using the same principle as EPROM.
- EEPROM: Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, which is further developed from EPROM and can be erased electrically. It can be operated by byte, but has low integration and is relatively expensive.

## Flash Memory

Flash memory is a long-life non-volatile (power-off retention) memory, which is a broad type of EEPROM because it is also electrically erasable ROM. The biggest difference between it and EEPROM is that it can only be read and written by sector (block), but its cost is lower than that of EEPROM. FLASH is divided into NOR FLASH and NAND FLASH.

The following are the categories of flash memory (in chronological order):

- NOR Flash: Data and address lines are separated, which allows for random access and read functions like RAM. This means that programs can run directly on NOR Flash without needing to be copied to RAM. However, NOR Flash has a small capacity and is divided into Parallel/Serial NOR Flash.
- NAND Flash: Data and address lines are multiplexed, which means that address lines cannot be used for random access and programs cannot run directly on it. However, NAND Flash has a large capacity and is available in SLC, MLC, TLC, and QLC.
- MMC: MMC interface, NAND Flash, and main controller.
- eMMC Flash: An embedded storage solution with an MMC interface (parallel data bus), NAND Flash, and main controller.
- UFS: Serial data bus, NAND Flash, and main controller.

## Other Knowledge

- The latest 5.1 standard for eMMC has a theoretical maximum speed of 400MB/s. The biggest advantage of UFS is its dual-channel bidirectional read and write capability. The UFS3.0 interface has a maximum bandwidth of 23.2Gbps, which is equivalent to 2.9GB/s.
- The circuit interface for eMMC is the same as that for SD cards. SD cards are simply soldered onto the PCB and fitted with gold fingers and a casing. eMMC supports 8-bit and 4-bit data buses, while the SD card standard uses a 4-bit data bus.
- eMMC has two buses, one for transmitting instruction data input and output, and an additional data strobe due to the parallel bus. UFS, on the other hand, has two differential data lanes, and instructions and data are sent in packet form.
- SSD = main controller + DRAM cache + NAND Flash
- eMMC = main controller + NAND Flash + standard package interface
