# Radio Frequency - Components and Systems - Wires

In radio frequency (RF) circuits, basic components such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors do not exhibit only one characteristic of resistance, capacitance, or inductance. We will start by analyzing the most basic components.

There are various forms of wires in RF circuits. The behavior of wires in the frequency spectrum largely depends on the diameter and length of the wire. The American Wire Gauge (AWG) specification defines the diameter of each wire gauge (the difference in AWG value is a factor of two in English diameter):

| AWG Value | Diameter (mil) |
| --------- | -------------- |
| 50        | 1              |
| 44        | 2              |
| 38        | 4              |
| 32        | 8              |
| 36        | 16             |
| 20        | 32             |
| 14        | 64             |

## Skin Effect

At low frequencies, the transmission of electrons covers the entire cross-section of the conductor. As the frequency increases, the enhancement of the magnetic field at the center of the cross-section creates impedance for electron transmission, pushing electrons to the edge and causing the current density at the center of the cross-section to be lower than that at the edge. This is known as the **skin effect**. The skin effect occurs in all conductors, including the pins of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

The depth at which the current density in the conductor drops to $\frac{1}{e} (37\%)$ of the edge depth is called the **skin depth**. This is a function related to frequency, conductor permeability, and conductivity, so different conductors have different skin depths.

The effect of the skin effect is to reduce the effective cross-sectional area of the conductor, increasing the AC impedance. For copper foil, the skin depth is about 0.85 cm at 60 Hz and about 0.007 cm at 1 MHz (i.e., 63% of the RF current flows within a width of 0.007 cm from the surface).

## Straight-Line Inductance

Any current-carrying medium produces a magnetic field. If the medium is AC current, the magnetic field will also alternate, creating a voltage on the wire that will prevent any current change. This phenomenon is called **self-inductance**, and we call components with this property inductors. Although straight-line inductance is negligible, it needs to be taken into account at high frequencies.

The size of straight-line inductance depends on the length and diameter, and the calculation formula is as follows:

$$
L=0.002l[2.3\log(\frac{4l}{d})-0.75] uH
$$

Here, the unit of inductance size $L$ is $uH$, and the unit of conductor length $l$ and diameter $d$ is $cm$.

Inductance is an important factor in RF design, and all inductors and RF circuits (including connecting wires, pins, etc.) exhibit inductance.
