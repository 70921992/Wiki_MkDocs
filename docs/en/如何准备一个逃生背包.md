## Choosing a Backpack

When choosing an emergency backpack, it is important to consider both the volume (able to hold enough necessities and tools) and the comfort of long-term carrying, while also avoiding being too conspicuous.

If we look at it from the perspective of choosing a hiking backpack, frameless backpacks are not suitable for use as emergency backpacks. On the one hand, their volume is too small, and on the other hand, their weight is all on the shoulders, which is not suitable for long-term hiking. While most external frame backpacks are suitable for long-term carrying, they are easily targeted for robbery due to their exaggerated volume and carrying system.

The most suitable choice for an emergency backpack is an internal frame backpack with a capacity of around 40L and a simple carrying system. In addition, its tear resistance and waterproof performance should also be considered.

## Water and Water Purification Methods

On the way to escape on foot, if the bottled water runs out, it is inevitable that drinking water needs to be obtained from nature.

The safest water purification method is to boil the water, which can kill bacteria and disinfect 100%, but it may not be possible due to lack of fuel or long time consumption. If boiling water is chosen, it is recommended to equip a metal kettle that can be split into a boiling water base.

Physical water purification methods include various filters, such as manual pumps, straw filters, and integrated filtering water bottles, but they can only filter impurities and cannot completely kill viruses.

Chemical methods include chlorine dioxide water purification tablets, which are small in size and light in weight, but can only purify relatively clear water.

## Food

On the way to escape, food should be chosen that is high in calories and easy to carry. The general choice is compressed dry food with beef jerky, plus a complex vitamin tablet.

## Clothing

When wearing clothing, cotton fabrics should be avoided as much as possible, and quick-drying, moisture-resistant, and warm fabrics should be chosen, with dark colors to be more concealed.

Close-fitting underwear can be made of lightweight, quick-drying fabrics, the middle layer can be made of warm materials such as fleece (lightweight, quick-drying, warm) or down (good compressibility, small volume after folding), and the outer jacket should be windproof and waterproof. Choose pants with good elasticity for the lower body. Knee pads and foldable hats can also be prepared as backups.

For shoe selection, hiking and mountaineering shoes can be referenced, with emphasis on foot feel, lightness, and waterproof performance, and they need to be worn in first.

## Shelter and Sleeping Gear

A small tent can be chosen for shelter, supplemented by a lightweight sleeping bag, and an inflatable moisture-proof pad can be added if conditions permit.

## Fire Starting Tools

Fire starting tools can be roughly divided into three types: lighters, fire starters, and waterproof matches. It is recommended to prepare at least two types and seal them in waterproof packaging.

## First Aid Kit

- Cuts: disinfectant cotton balls/wipes, band-aids, medical tape, gauze, iodine, cotton swabs, bandages, etc.
- Oral medications: ibuprofen/aspirin (relieve fever, headache, or inflammation), La Baozhenglu pills, dimenhydrinate (anti-motion sickness), cold medicine.
- Medical tools: rubber gloves, tweezers, insect repellent (DEET, can also help start a fire), N95 masks.

## Electronic Products

- Mobile phones: prepare an extra phone with a SIM card.

- Whistle: for sending distress signals.
