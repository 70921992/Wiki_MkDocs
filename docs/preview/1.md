而克劳德·威廉姆森的演奏，

钢琴、贝斯、鼓

🎵Pretendo🎵

_Pretendo_ 收录自 Claude Williamson Trio 的《国境の南・太陽の西》爵士三重奏乐辑，乐音明快而干净，其间又蕴藏着轻轻的孤独。忘了说，它是由 Nat King Cole 的 _Pretend_ 改编而来，一首很经典的爵士乐，它是这样唱的：

> Pretend you're happy when you're blue
> It isn't very hard to do
> And you'll find happiness without an end
> Whenever you pretend
>
> Remember anyone can dream
> And nothing's bad as it may seem
> The little things you haven't got
> Could be a lot, if you'd pretend
>
> You'll find a love you can share
> One you can call all your own
> Just close your eyes, he'll be there
> You'll never be alone
>
> And if you sing this melody
> You'll be pretending just like me
> The world is mine, it can be yours my friend
> So, why don't you pretend
>
> And if you sing this melody
> You'll be pretending just like me
> The world is mine, it can be yours my friend
> So, why don't you pretend

把台灯调至暖光，假装它是一炉暖烘烘的火，我斟上一小杯加了冰的威士忌，品味着窗外秋风掠过树梢、枫叶和银杏叶轻轻落地的声响。在南方不曾有的深秋，在一场雾和一场雨中如约而至。

世间的变化真快啊！不管是朝令人期待的方向，抑或是不太明朗的方向，总归是悄声无息，却又铺天盖地向前推进着。
