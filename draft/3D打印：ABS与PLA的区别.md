# 3D Printing: Differences between ABS and PLA

How to choose between ABS and PLA materials for 3D printing?

## ABS Material

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a traditional material used for 3D printing.

### Printing Temperature

When using ABS for printing, the printer nozzle temperature is generally set between 210-240℃, and the bed temperature is above 80℃. Additionally, the softening temperature of ABS is 105℃.

### Printing Performance

ABS prints smoothly but may experience warping and detachment when cooled.

### Strength

ABS has high strength and elasticity, so it will only bend under pressure and not break.

### Odor

ABS produces an odor during printing. It is best to use a closed printer or maintain good ventilation to avoid inhaling too much gas.

### Usage

ABS is suitable for scenarios that require toughness, high temperature resistance, and frequent collisions. However, printers without a heated bed cannot use ABS for printing due to the risk of warping and detachment. It is also not recommended to use ABS in poorly ventilated rooms.

## PLA Material

PLA (Polylactic Acid) is a biodegradable plastic, some of which even meet food-grade standards.

### Printing Temperature

When using PLA for printing, the printer nozzle temperature is generally set between 180-200℃, and the bed temperature is not necessary but recommended to be set at 60℃. Additionally, the softening temperature of PLA is 60℃.

### Printing Performance

Compared to ABS, PLA is more prone to clogging the nozzle during printing (because it is more adhesive and extensible when melted), but it does not experience warping and detachment.

### Strength

PLA has lower elasticity and strength, but this can be addressed by adjusting the filling and wall thickness settings during printing.

### Usage

PLA is relatively environmentally friendly (because it is biodegradable), affordable, and does not warp or produce odors during printing. However, it is not suitable for high-temperature or collision scenarios, as temperatures above 60℃ and impacts can cause deformation or breakage of the printed product.
